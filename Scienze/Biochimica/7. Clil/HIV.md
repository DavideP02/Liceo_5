# HIV

HIV invades immune system cells especially helper T cells. 
These helper T cells have a vital role in the immune system.When a helper T cell is activated (by having an antigen [a piece of foreign protein] presented to it, it begins to divide into memory T cells and effector T cells.
Killer T cells deplete helper T cells (those that produce memory cells that can remember and recognize HIV).
Loss of helper T cells is costly, but the immune system now primed to recognize and attack the viral protein.

What’s the problem?
Virus mutates and the proteins on its outer surface change.These new surface proteins are not recognized by the immune system’s memory cells.Mutant virus particles bearing new surface proteins survive immune system attack and begin new round of infection

Each round of infection reduces numbers of helper T cells because they are infected by virus and destroyed.

Furthermore, because each lineage of T cells has a limited capacity for replication, after a finite number of rounds of replication the body’s supply of helper T cells becomes exhausted.  The immune system eventually is overwhelmed and collapses.
