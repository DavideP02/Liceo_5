He was a novelist, a playwright and a critic, but it is as a playwright that he is most widely known.

He was born in Dublin in 1906 from a middlle class family, and he studied modern literature, and he specialized in French and Italian. After his studies at university he went to Paris to work as a lecturer of english. He travelled through Germany, French, Ireland, England, and then he finally settled in France. 

He published his early novels in english, but then he turned to french, and it is in French that he first published his masterpieces: *En attendant Godot* (1952, published in english in 1955 as *Waiting for Godot*) and *Fin de Partie* (1957, published in english in 1958 as *End Game*). He became famous for the first play. 
He first published these plays in France and then he translated it in english.

In 1969 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literatura, and he finally died in 1989.

Some critics consider Beckett as the last modernist. He is somewhere in between modernism and present age.

## The theatre of the absurd

He is considered the main representative of the **theatre of the absurd**. With this expression we refer to a group of dramatist who wrote between the 1950s and 1960s, and the main feature of these dramatist is that they gave expression to feelings of loss, meaninglessness, confusion; they gave expression to that sense of nullity and absurdity.

The atomic bomb on Iroshima and Nagasaki, as well as the nazi death-camps had shocked the whole world, to the point that a german theorist, Adorno, said that art was no longer possible after Aushwitz.
Samuel Beckett answered with his literary production and with his theatre of absurd, challenging Adorndo point of view.

Samuel Beckett is considered the main representative of the theatre of the absurd, with his plays he confronted men with this absence of meanings, which emerges after WWII.
He presented man trapped in everyday living, with the need of finding meanings and purposes from the past which however are no longer valid for the present. He portrayed this sense of nullity, this idea of non existance, of meaninglessness, and he express this nostalgia for past meanings which were no longer usefull after what had happened.

## *Waiting fot Godot*

This play is subtitled "a tragicomedy in two acts".
This play has both comic and tragic elements, there are some ironic connotation, as well as some terrifing implication. It is divided into two acts, but both are very similar, because there is no real plot. What happens in the first act, happens also in the second one, with some differences.

The first words of this play are "nothing to be done", and in fact it happens nothing in this play.
We find two characters, **Vladimir** and **Estragon**, they two tramps, they stand by a tree in a road, and they talk with each other while they wait for a misterious figure, Mr. Godot. They fill time with their meaningless discussion, they play absurd wordgames.
While they are waiting two others characters appear, Pozzo and Lucky.
At the end of the first act, an unnamed boy appears on stage, saying that Godot's arrival is postponed, because he will arrive the next day.
Thi is exactly what happened also in the second act, with the difference that Pozzo and this unnamed boy do not remember about the previous day.

In this play there is no action, it's the situation that take precedence over action. Samuel Beckett wanted to show the absence of purposes and meaning in life.
The structure is almost simmetrical, circular because there is no beginning and there is no end. The audience had the impression that this repetition will continue to go on endlessly.

In this play we find five characters: Vladimr and Estragon, Pozzo and Lucky and this unnamed boy. Four of these five character can be grouped in complementary couples:

- Vladimir and Estragon are mutually dependend, one cannot exist without the other; they do not have the same personality, they are complementary: Vladimir is the most practical, rational and intellectual, whereas Estragon is more childish, and he tends to fall asleep and to dream, while Vladimir is speaking: they are mutually dependent.
- Lucky and Pozzo: Pozzo is the master, and Lucky is the slave: When they appear on stage, Pozzo is drawing Lucky with a rope, so they are mutually dependend in the same way Vladimir and Estragon are. 

Pozzo cannot remember anything about the previous day, whereas Lucky can, and so we can make an other distinction among these characters:

- Vladimir and Lucky, as they stand for the intellect
- Estragon and Pozzo, as they stand for the body

In this play Beckett was also able to show the duality between mind and body.

We don't know much about the unnamed boy and about the others characters: in this play there is little plot and also little charactarization.

There is also Godot, who never appears: the tramps perceive that Godot might give meaning to their life, but they also fear him.
Critics have discussed about the real identity of Godot: Beckett said that not even him knew who Godot was. Critics said that Godot might represents God. 

Actually this play ends with the words
> Let's Go.

Even if we don't see Godot in stage, ironically in the end of the stage it appears, since "go." is the same as "go dot". 
Godot can also be paralled with the idea of ending, if he had appeared on the stage the play would have found its end, but this play is centered on repetition.

In spite of the reiterated theme of nonexistance, the characters actually go on existing; it seems that they are trapped on stage, they would like to leave the stage but they are compelled to stay.
They are compelled to stay because of the existance of the play itself, which is to be performed. 

For Becket not only life and society are absurd, but we also see how art becomes part of the tirany of existance: art like life is an act of creation and continuance, but art can no longer provide us with meanings capable of filling our interior void; art is no longer capable of providing us a solution for our sense of misery.
His position is different from that of Joyce and Eliot, who saw art as a pseudo-religion form of salvation.

### Themes

The most important theme is the **theme of waiting**: all the play revolves around this continuosly postponed meeting with mister Godot: this is the first theme: the individual trapped in a constant process of waiting.

**Inability to act** through the representation of action without progression: there is no action, no progression, its the situation that rules the play.

**Incomunicability** between human beings: Vladimir and Estragon go on talking, but they talk about nothing: they aren't really communicating.

**Sterility of the world**: this is evident from the sterile connotation of their dialogues, but also this is an aspect that we can infer from the absence of women and also from the setting, which is minimalistic (there is only a solitary tree)

**Characters' lack of memory**

### T: *Waiting*

This extract is taken from the end of the play, from the second act. 

The setting is always the same, these two tramps stand by the side of a road, next to this solitary tree, the setting is minimalistic as the plot is, but there is no real sense of place: it could be any road or any tree.

An unnamed boy appears, bringing the news that Mr. Godot won't come that evening, maybe he will come the following name; this boy delivers the message to Vladimir; Estragon is actually sleeping.
Some traits emerges and distinguish them, even though there is little characterization.

They decided not to go anywhere, and they decided to stay there in order to keep on waiting for Godot arrival. They consider the possibility of commiting suicide, but they abandon this idea since they do not have the physical instruments to kill themselves, they consider the possibility of using Estragon belt, which is too short and not strong enough.
There is an other reason that prevent them to taking their life again: death would signify a permanent separation between the two: they are mutually dependent, and they cannot part, they cannot separate: they both know that each one depends on the other, because it is the other that gives the sense that they exist. So there is a relationship of interdependence and also of affection apparently.

But this affection is only apparent: they keep talking to each other, but we have the idea that they are both immersed in their own universe, and they do not really try to communicate in what their universe consists

The language is simple, quit informal and essential. The dialogue is made up of a lot of ready made phrases, and it also made up of a lot of silences and pauses, which are meant to interupt the flow of conversation. There are a lot of repetition which are meant to reproduce the repetitiveness of life.
Words often have a double sense, a comic sense and a tragic sense. There is a peculiarity: this play is not only characterized by the combination of comic elements on the one hand and tragic elements on the other hand: this play is characterized by events and words that have both comic and tragic meaning simultanuosly.

The final message that we find in this play is that nothing can be done by contemporary men except for waiting. Becket is trying to make the audience feel and share this process of waiting, and then he want to make the audience experience the quality of inaction.

## Different types of theatre

It evidente that **Becket** moved away from the traditional features of drama.

**Oscar Wilde**'s plots are based on the idea of social climbing, while in **Shaw**'s plots there is always a social theme (the theatre was conceived as a tool to improve society). In **Becket** there is no plot.

**Wilde**'s setting is London High Society; **Shaw** uses London as a setting of his plays, but not only the upper classes; in **Becket** the setting is minimalistic and symbolic

The characters are outsiders for **Becket**, while in **Shaw** characters are mouthpeaces of the playwrights idea: he wanted to bring social issues to light, in order to improve society. In **Wilde** the characters are [stereotipati], since they are meant to entertain and satirize about the Victorian society.

**Wilde**'s aim was to entertain and satirize about the Victorian society without letting the audience thinking, **Shaw**'s aim was to improve society, he uses is theatre as a weapon and so he wasn't really appreciated since he attacked to harsh the society. **Beckett**'s aim was to highlight the lack of communication and the absence of meaning and purposes of contemporary society.
