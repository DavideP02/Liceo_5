# Alfred Tennyson
==p. 32-33 - V==

He was the fourth of ten children, and he was born in 1809. His father was the priest in a small village, and he is also a scholar and a man of great artistic taste; he had a well stocked library.
He was subject of depression and heavy drinking, but he took charge of the education of his children. Alfred boyhood was quite happy.

When he was 19 Alfred went to study at Trinity College, where he made friend with a brilliant young poet, Arthur Henry Hallam. But 4 years later financial problems compelled him to leave Cambridge, and he went back to his house, but his father died shortly afterwards; the family was allowed to stay into the rectory [casa del prete] for six more years.

In 1832, he traveled on the continent , with Hallam, and Hallam for that time had became engaged with one of Tennyson’s sisters; but in 1833 Hallam suddenly dies in Vienna, and his death proved a terrible blow for Terryson. For 17 years he continued to brood [portare il lutto] over it, and he eventually publish an elegy, dedicated to his friend, entitled _In memoriam HHH_, where he express his sorrow for his lost friend.

In 1850 it was a turning point in his life.
* He married his sweetheart; he had fallen in love with her four years before, but the marriage had always be forbidden by Emily’s father, because of the poet financial insecurity.
* He publish _In memoriam_, which set on him a seal of fame
* He is appointed Poet Laureate (the first after Worthwords).

Since 1850 his life was characterized by fame, money and success. In 1884 he was elevated to the peerage [members of the House of Lords in parliament]

He died in 1892, and was buried in the Poets’ Corner, in the Westminster abbey.

## Features of his works
Unlike Browning Tennyson was a real victorian writer; he was born on the same year as Darwin, and in a way he anticipated Darwin’s theories of evolution, although he was more concerned with the spiritual evolution of mankind than with the biological one.

* He was very much interested by science, and he was able to work out a compromise between science and religion, suggesting the progressive development of the human race, both through the succession of generations on Earth, and through the belief in a life after death
* He was interested in political and historical events, that changed the face of Europe, and he often found subjects for his poems among them.
* He was influenced by the grace and musicality of the romantics, in fact he was called a romantic of the third generation, but he was a true victorian when he emphasizes the importance of balance and discipline in form
* He was concerned with the social values of his time, and tried to face the great questions of his age, like family, patriotism, love and religion.
* He borrowed most of his themes from the Middle Ages, from classical antiquity and from old legends; he always added a personal note into them. This note was often melancholic.

## T: Ulysses

It is a celebration of the ancient hero, but Tennyson’s Ulysses is an old and tired king, who rules over an island inhabited by people who are only concerned with material life.
He has fought the long war of Troy; he has met dangers and adventures of any sorts and he has became famous all over the world for the idea of the horse.

Although he is old, and he guesses that little remains for him to live, he wants to set sails for the extreme adventure before death closes everything.

His adventure is spurred by his intention
> to follow knowledge like a sinking star;

this make him similar to Dante’s Ulysses, the hero that induced his companion to leave Ithaca, their families and their certainties
> per seguir virtute e canoscenza

Although he is old, he is ready to challenge the world, death and the unknown.
Unlike Dante’s Ulysses, he is not going to break a divine law, because the 19th century faith in science and in progress had long cancelled men’s fears of going beyond the limits imposed to men by God; Dante put Ulysses in hell because he had trespassed the limits imposed to men by God: the pillar of Hercules.

Ulysses becomes the expression of the dynamic man of Tennyson’s time, who believes he has the right and the duty to exploit all the possibilities of human intelligence.
From this point of view, he is contrasted to his own son Telemachus, who represents the balancing force of stability and conservation. Paradoxically Ulysses, who is the father, is more active of Telemachus who is the son and much younger.

Ulysses represents an active, adventurous life, rich in imagination and enthusiasm, though sometimes it seems like a sort of escape.

Telemachus represents a more sedentary life, full of responsibilities and social duties, though sometimes lacking in enthusiasm, with a more materialistic view.

The relationship between father and son is anyway healthy and strong, and based on mutual respect.

We can also say that Ulysses is the poet’s alter ego, because he gives expression to his torturing doubts about men’s destiny and men’s end role, and about life after death.

In general Ulysses became a metaphor for human existence, in which even the most optimistic vision of life - the one which interprets life as material and intellectual progress - is never separated from the melancholic awareness of the destiny of decline and death, reserved to us all.

The persona who is speaking is the king Ulysses, who is addressing his speech to his companions. Their presence is essential but passive, they are never interlocutors.
The character of Ulysses is rich and poignantly human; he is aware he has lived the best part of his life; he knows he has lost the integrity of his body and his energies, and he knows that death will soon put an end to everything. This gives a note of melancholy to the poem, and throws an ambiguous light on its immediate optimism.

The main sources of the monologue are Homer’s _Odyssey_ and Dante’s _Inferno_;
* Homer represents the perfect hero in the odyssey, who conquers troy, roams the whole world, came back to Ithaca and defeats all his enemies;
* Ulysses by Dante represents the tragic hero, who is punished for trying to learn to much, and goes beyond the limits of human knowledge; actually Dante puts Ulysses in hell for the sin of **fraud**, because of the deceit with the Trojan horse; moreover his passion for exploration has overcame his affection for his family. He is a multifarious character.

Ulysses by Tennyson represents the old hero who still wishes to travel and to learn, with a free heart and a free mind.

The first five lines are devoted to the description of Ulysses situation on Ithaca. He reveals dissatisfaction and contempt for his present life, which is boring and meaningless.; he expresses a deep nostalgia, a deep craving for his past adventures; there he is bored to death.
