# 27 nov 2020 - The Brontë Sister
==p. 54==

They are Charlotte, Emily and Anne, and they were the daughter of a priest, and their father have married a woman of delicate constitution who gave him 6 children before dying.

When he remained a widow, he asked his sister-in-law to come and help him; she was a very severe and austere woman, very cold and detached, and she came to look after the children, but in fact they were left much to themself. 
They were usually alone, because mister Brontë was really egocentric and spent most of his days alone.

Four of the five girls were sent to a school for clergymen’s daughters, were the fees were very low, but the food was very bad and discipline was hard.
Here  the two eldest, Maria and Elizabeth, died, probably of tubercolosi, and after that Charlotte and Emily were brought back home.

There were 4 children left, and they were extremely precocious and clever; they spent their time in unmethodical study: they used to read and paint.

 They went to Brussels, to study French and then come back. 

Charlotte and Emily tried to open a school in their village, but they found no people.

In 1846 the three sisters jointly published at their expense, a collection of poems, but it attracted no attention. After that the three sisters devoted themself to the novel writing.

All of the Brontë brothers had a dramatic destiny; Anne died in 1849 at the age of 29; Emily died at 30,  on 1848; Patrick, who was a talented painter, died in 1848 after a dissolute life and charlotte died in 1855 at 39.
