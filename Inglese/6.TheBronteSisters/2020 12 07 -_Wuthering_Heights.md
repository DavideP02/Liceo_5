* the denotation of **cliff** is a high area of rock with a steapside, and the connotation is strenght, loneliness and danger.

So Heathcliff is a particular character, we know that he is the outsider of the novel, and that his arrival triggers a series of dramatic events. We also get to know that he is a man uncontaminated by society, living in fusion with the world of nature.
Heathcliff is fears determined and wild.

He will have to disappear: at the end of the novel, he will die and also his son will not survive, because his name must disappear, for the future of the two families.

## Heathcliff's despair

==p. 70==

It's the moment in which Heathcliff get to know that Catherine has died by giving birth to her daughter Cathy, who was born from the marriage between Catherine and Linton.

Here Nelly Dean informs Heathcliff about the death of Catherine: the reaction is violente and terrible: he is destroyed and he cannot survive this by keeping his balance. At the beginning she is worried because she doesn't know what his reaction will be like.

He says
> ‘She’s dead!’ he said; ‘I’ve not waited for you to learn that. Put your handkerchief away – don’t  snivel before me. Damn you all! she wants none of your tears!’

Nelly Dean is sensitive, and she whips and she says
> we do sometimes pity creatures that have none of the feeling either for themselves or others

Heathcliff wants to know how she died, but moreover he wants to know if she has pronounced his name before she died; he is so disperate that when Nelly Dean says that she didn't mention him, Heathcliff curses Nelly Dean.

Catherine was his **life** and his **soul**: we get to know that Heathcliff feels exactly what Catherine declared before.

Nelly Dean is desperate, because she cannot help him, neither confort him, so she leaves.
Heathcliff acts like a wounded animal
> He dashed his head against the knotted trunk; and, lifting up his eyes, howled, not like a man, but like a savage beast being goaded to death with knives and spears.

From now on he will live in _torment_.

Also here we see that one of the most important themes of the novel is the theme of **opposing forces**: here there is the principle of storms and energy opposed to the principle of calm and settled assurance.
They are opposed but they are complementary: they ideally tend to unity.

Also in getting the news of Catherine death, Heathcliff reveals his character and the violence passion that live in him.

The setting of Wuthering High is one of the protagonist's of the novel. We know that there are two places that are opposed to each other: Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange.
The fact that the novel takes the title from the first, means that that is the setting, and the other is its opposition.

_Wuthering Heights_ is described as a solitary, gloomy strong building: it is a place of the mind; it is the place Heathcliff and Catherine belongs to; which they try to leave and where they always return. _Thrushcross Grange_ is a place of order and normality; into _Wuthering Heights_ everything has a dramatic violence; they are Heaven and hell.

_Wuthering Heights_ is a metaphore of childhood, a place peopled with creatures of imagination, while _Thrushcross Grange_ is the place of adulthood.

We know that the characters of the novel belong to two generation of two different families: the Earnshaws, from Wuthering Heights, and the Lintons, that live in Thrushcross Grange. Heathcliff is a sort of link between the two families.
