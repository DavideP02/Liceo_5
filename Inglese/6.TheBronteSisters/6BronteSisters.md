# The Brontë sisters

==p. 54 - V==

They are Charlotte, Emily and Anne, and they were the daughter of a priest, and their father have married a woman of delicate constitution who gave him 6 children before dying.

When he remained a widow, he asked his sister-in-law to come and help him; she was a very severe and austere woman, very cold and detached, and she came to look after the children, but in fact they were left much to themself.
They were usually alone, because mister Brontë was really egocentric and spent most of his days alone.

Four of the five girls were sent to a school for clergymen’s daughters, were the fees were very low, but the food was very bad and discipline was hard.
Here  the two eldest, Maria and Elizabeth, died, probably of tubercolosi, and after that Charlotte and Emily were brought back home.

There were 4 children left, and they were extremely precocious and clever; they spent their time in unmethodical study: they used to read and paint.

They went to Brussels, to study French and then come back.

Charlotte and Emily tried to open a school in their village, but they found no people.

In 1846 the three sisters jointly published at their expense, a collection of poems, but it attracted no attention. After that the three sisters devoted themself to the novel writing.

All of the Brontë brothers had a dramatic destiny; Anne died in 1849 at the age of 29; Emily died at 30,  on 1848; Patrick, who was a talented painter, died in 1848 after a dissolute life and charlotte died in 1855 at 39.

## Life and works
Charlotte (1816-55), Emily (1818-48) and Anne (1820-49) were the daughters of an Anglican clergyman of Irish origin, who had an important influence on their artistic inclinations. The Brontë sisters spent most of their life in isolation in a remote part of Yorkshire, in northern England. They did not receive a formal education. Apart from brief periods at school, they were mainly self educated, reading widely from their father’s library and drawing inspiration from the local public library or from periodicals. To express their intellectual creativity and their emotions, they began to write chronicles of imaginary countries and, in 1846, they published a volume of poetry, _Poems by Currer, Ellis and Acton_ Bell. Like many female writers of the period, they decided to use pseudonyms. It was under these pen names that each of the sisters published their novels the following year: Charlotte (Currer) published _Jane Eyre_, Emily (Ellis) _Wuthering Heights_, and Anne (Acton) _Agnes Grey_. Only Jane Eyre was immediately successful, and was followed by other two novels by Charlotte: _Shirley_ (1849) and _Villette_ (1853). The other two sisters soon died of consumption: Emily in 1848 and Anne in 1849. Charlotte married Reverend Arthur Bell Nicholls in 1854 and died the following year, probably of an illness due to pregnancy.

## Wuthering Heights

The novel start at the end of the story and then it is narrated in flashbacks.
This makes it a complex novel.
The atmosphere is gothic, nightmarish and unreal. The story goes backwards and forwards; the novel covers two generations of families, and it is linked by the character of Heathcliff.

There are two storytellers, Mr Lockwood and Nelly Dean, and there are three literary influences that acted on the novel:
* **romanticism**, because of the great role played by nature, that is nearly a co-protagonist; it is also romantic because Heathcliff is a _byronic hero_, that has a dark secret that chases and ruined his life;
* **realism**: it is mirrored in the social aspect of the novel; the features that are realistic are _the description of the settings_, _the conflict between two cultures_ and also _the complexity of the characters personality_;
* **gothic**: there is more of a touch of gothicism: nightmarish dream, the ghosts, superstition, prophecies

The novel closes with the reconciliation of the two spheres of the fantastic and the real.

The most important theme is the analysis of passion, that transcends the romantic conception of love, which here is strong and uncontrollable; it is similar to a natural force. It is both creative and destructive, nor sexual nor intellectual, but just an impulse, which binds together Catherine and Heathcliff: in fact they totally identify with each other.

Heathcliff is a romantic hero because of his aspiration toward a pure and complete identification with her. He represents the dynamic principle of the search of perfection against the static principle of acceptance of reality as it is

### Plot
The novel revolves around two houses, Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange, respectively inhabited by the Earnshaws and the Lintons. At the beginning of the story Mr Lockwood, the new tenant of Thrushcross Grange, visits his landlord, Mr Heathcliff, at Wuthering Heights. Forced to stay the night because of a snowstorm, Mr Lockwood has a strange dream about a girl, Catherine, who is tapping on the window, asking to be let in after 20 years of wandering on the moors. The next day Mr Lockwood returns to Thrushcross Grange and the housekeeper, Nelly Dean, tells him the whole story of the family from the Heights. Mr Earnshaw, the father of Hindley and Catherine, one day came back from Liverpool with a foundling, whom he called Heathcliff. Hindley ill-treated Heathcliff whereas Catherine got on very well with him. They roamed the moors together and promised they would stay together forever. One day Catherine was bitten by one of the Lintons’ dogs and was forced to spend five weeks at Thrushcross Grange to recover, which gave her the opportunity to get to know Edgar and Isabella, as well as their quiet and refined way of life. So when a few years later Edgar proposed to her, she accepted. She told Nelly Dean she would not marry Heathcliff because he was socially inferior. Heathcliff overheard part of the conversation and disappeared to return only three years later, handsome, rich and determined to take his revenge. He won the possession of Wuthering Heights gambling with Hindley, now a drunkard; then he eloped with Edgar’s sister, Isabella, married her and treated her like a servant. Catherine fell ill and died giving birth to a daughter, Cathy. Years later, Heathcliff kidnapped Cathy and obliged her to marry his weakly, spoilt son, Linton. His revenge was thus complete since he became the owner of Thrushcross Grange, too. Nelly’s narrative ends here. Mr Lockwood leaves Yorkshire and comes back after a year to find out that both Linton and Heathcliff are dead and Cathy and Hareton, Hindley’s son, are going to get married, to live in peace and happiness. Nelly tells Lockwood that there are rumours in the neighbourhood that the figures of a young man and woman have been seen wandering together in the moors.

### Themes
In the novel basic human emotions, such as love and hatred, are presented in a state of purity and concentration. The spirit of Romanticism and its concern with the human soul are still present in the correspondence between the violent passions of the characters and the wild natural landscape. Death is an important theme. Unlike other Victorian novels, where death is either a moment of forgiveness or the moment when all the conflicts are settled, in Wuthering Heights death is not an end, but a liberation of the spirit. The novel closes with the vision of the graveyard where Catherine and Heathcliff are buried, but the author is careful to say that they are sleeping, not dead. The Gothic elements in the novel, such as the sinister atmosphere of Wuthering Heights – surrounded by the wilderness –, Catherine’s ghost, and the dreams and superstitions often mentioned, are used not to frighten the reader, but to convey the struggle between the two opposed principles of love and hate, of order and chaos.

### Structure and style
The narrative mode is a system of Chinese boxes, a ‘concentric’ system of narratives. There are two major narrators, male and female, outsider and insider. Mr Lockwood, the polite visitor from the city, is the outsider; apart from a few occasions when he narrates what he sees, he simply writes down, in the form of a journal, what Nelly tells him. Nelly Dean is the second narrator, closely involved in the story and entirely reliable. Other characters occasionally narrate to Nelly. The narration does not proceed according to chronological time; it starts almost at the end of the story and develops a narrative within the narrative, including the use of flashbacks. This complex structure creates a sense of verisimilitude and, at the same time, a feeling of suspense. The continuous flowing of human life into the natural world creates moments of intense poetry and mysticism that are balanced by the concreteness and common sense of Nelly’s language. Wuthering Heights represents a unique achievement in Victorian literature. Often compared to a Shakespearean tragedy for its rendering of turbulent passions, unnatural crimes and cruelty, the novel marked a departure from the observation of society towards the description of the individual personality, and anticipated the novelists of the early 20th century in narrative technique.

### T: I am Heathcliff
==p. 65 - V==

In this part the narrator is Nelly Dean.
This passage is a sort of climax and a turning point in the story, for many reasons:
1. it strips out the kind of love that binds Catherine and Heathcliff, which is an uncontrollable love, that is beyond the limits of human understanding
2. it is based on a misunderstanding: Nelly Dean and Catherine are talking, and Catherine is opening her heart to the servant, and paradoxically and while she is listing the reasons why she is going to marry Edgar Lington, she fully reveals her love for Heathcliff. Heathcliff is eavesdropping the conversation but he doesn’t listen to the whole conversation, but only to the part in which she say why she couldn’t marry Heathcliff, and than he leaves on a misunderstanding
3. this is a turning point, since from now on Catherine falls ill for a long time, she nearly dies for heartbreak and she recovers and marries Edgar

==The first section, from line 1 to 55==

Catherine explains the reasons why she has decided to marry Edgar Linton: the reasons are underlined in pink; the words and phrases related to Catherine’s behavior are highlighted in pink. They denote an highly sensitive and emotional nature.

The reasons for marrying Edgar are the classical reasons for marrying a man; as Catherine goes on speaking, we realize her real motivations she is concerned with Heathcliff’s present condition of servitude due to her brother’s treatment of him. The real reason underneath the decision of marrying Edgar is to protect Heathcliff from her brother’s violence. Acquiring a higher social status, Catherine might help Heathcliff to improve his present conditions.

The words highlighted in light blue describes Nelly’s attitude: they are very rational and pragmatic; she encourages Catherine to reflects on the reasons and consequences of her choice .

==The second section, from line 56 to 93==
* There is Catherine dream: she tells a dream to Nelly Dean.
* Nelly is aware and conscious of Heathcliff presence outside the door, but Catherine is not. The confession starts.
* Catherine says that she loves Heathcliff’s and she compares the two men, with words related to heat and cold. The words referred to Edgar are cold, while Heathcliff lightning and fire.

==The third section, from line 94 to the end==

Here it’s dealt Catherine’s love for Heathcliff.
* At line 119 there is why she marries Edgar: “If I marry Linton,, I can aid Heathcliff to rise, and place him out of my brother’s power”

Catherine says she is a part of Heathcliff, she feels his pains, if he didn’t exist she wouldn’t have a reason to live. Their love seems to have nothing to do with sexual attraction or physical desire.
Their relationship is one of the soul, it is eternal and unchangeable, their love is concerned with the metaphysical and the impersonal.
The love’s nature is religious, not only in its mystiques but in the awareness of the incompleteness of all the elements that makes up human nature.
It’s absolute, romantic, intense and passionate.

#### Plot
Catherine speaks to Nelly in the kitchen. Neither of them is aware at first that Heathcliff is listening to their conversation. Catherine tells Nelly about Edgar’s marriage proposal and that she accepted. Nelly asks her if and why she loves Edgar, and she replies she does for a variety fo material reasons: he is rich, handsome and respectable. Nelly disapproves, and Catherine admits that she is doing the wrong thing. Then she tells Nelly that she had a dream in which she went to heaven and was unhappy there because she missed Wuthering Heights. She compares her marriage to Linton to being in heaven. She explains that, although she loves Heathcliff very much, she cannot marry him because Hindley has degraded him too much and she would be degraded too. Heathcliff leaves the room full of shame, humiliation and despair, and so he is not present to hear Catherine say that she loves him more deeply than anything else in the world.
Nelly emphasizes that Heathcliff would be deserted if she marries Linton, and Catherine indignantly replies that she is not going to desert Heathcliff, but will use her influence to raise him up in society She adds that they are such kindred spirits that they are the same person.

### About Heathcliff

Some details about the name "Heathcliff": it's formed by **heath**, _brughiera_, and **cliff**, which is _roccia scoscesa_;
* the denotation of the word **heath** is an area of open land where rough grass and heder grow, with few trees and bushes; the connotation of the word is wild character and love for freedom
* the denotation of **cliff** is a high area of rock with a steapside, and the connotation is strenght, loneliness and danger.

So Heathcliff is a particular character, we know that he is the outsider of the novel, and that his arrival triggers a series of dramatic events. We also get to know that he is a man uncontaminated by society, living in fusion with the world of nature.
Heathcliff is fears determined and wild.

He will have to disappear: at the end of the novel, he will die and also his son will not survive, because his name must disappear, for the future of the two families.
At the end of the novel the descendent of the two families will re-establish order and give life to **Thrushcross Grange**. This will happen after the death of Heathcliff and his son: harmony will be re-establish.

### T: Heathcliff's despair

==p. 70==

It's the moment in which Heathcliff get to know that Catherine has died by giving birth to her daughter Cathy, who was born from the marriage between Catherine and Linton.

Here Nelly Dean informs Heathcliff about the death of Catherine: the reaction is violente and terrible: he is destroyed and he cannot survive this by keeping his balance. At the beginning she is worried because she doesn't know what his reaction will be like.

He says
> ‘She’s dead!’ he said; ‘I’ve not waited for you to learn that. Put your handkerchief away – don’t  snivel before me. Damn you all! she wants none of your tears!’

Nelly Dean is sensitive, and she whips and she says
> we do sometimes pity creatures that have none of the feeling either for themselves or others

Heathcliff wants to know how she died, but moreover he wants to know if she has pronounced his name before she died; he is so disperate that when Nelly Dean says that she didn't mention him, Heathcliff curses Nelly Dean.

Catherine was his **life** and his **soul**: we get to know that Heathcliff feels exactly what Catherine declared before.

Nelly Dean is desperate, because she cannot help him, neither confort him, so she leaves.
Heathcliff acts like a wounded animal
> He dashed his head against the knotted trunk; and, lifting up his eyes, howled, not like a man, but like a savage beast being goaded to death with knives and spears.

From now on he will live in _torment_.

Also here we see that one of the most important themes of the novel is the theme of **opposing forces**: here there is the principle of storms and energy opposed to the principle of calm and settled assurance.
They are opposed but they are complementary: they ideally tend to unity.

Also in getting the news of Catherine death, Heathcliff reveals his character and the violence passion that live in him.

### Settings

The setting of Wuthering High is one of the protagonist's of the novel. We know that there are two places that are opposed to each other: Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange.
The fact that the novel takes the title from the first, means that that is the setting, and the other is its opposition.

_Wuthering Heights_ is described as a solitary, gloomy strong building: it is a place of the mind; it is the place Heathcliff and Catherine belongs to; which they try to leave and where they always return. _Thrushcross Grange_ is a place of order and normality; into _Wuthering Heights_ everything has a dramatic violence; they are Heaven and hell.

_Wuthering Heights_ is a metaphore of childhood, a place peopled with creatures of imagination, while _Thrushcross Grange_ is the place of adulthood.

We know that the characters of the novel belong to two generation of two different families: the Earnshaws, from Wuthering Heights, and the Lintons, that live in Thrushcross Grange. Heathcliff is a sort of link between the two families.

---

The novel is built around the contrast between the two houses on the Yorkshire moors: Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. Wuthering Heights is severe and gloomy, firmly rooted in local tradition and custom; it is the appropriate background for the life of unrestrained and primitive passion led by its owner, Heathcliff. Thrushcross Grange, the home of the bourgeois Lintons, reflects their conception of life, based on stability, kindness and respectability. So the two mansions stand for two opposing forces: the principle of storm and energy on the one hand, and the principle of calm and settled assurance on the other. Though opposed, they are complementary and ideally tend to unity. With the marriage between Hareton and Cathy, they will finally compose a harmony at the end of the novel, after the consummation of Heathcliff’s revenge and his death.

### The Byronic hero

The hero, Heathcliff, is described as a sort of ‘Byronic hero’, moved by irresistible passion, doomed to the despair of a solitary life and finally tending to a total identity with his love, Catherine. Yet, Heathcliff also appears as a Gothic villain in his inhuman treatment of his wife and even his son. Catherine is driven partly by her social ambitions, which finally lead her to marry Edgar, but she is also prompted to violate social conventions. She embodies a wild and Romantic nature.

---

Heathcliff is a Byronic hero.

The Byronic Hero is a moody, passionate, restless and misterious man, who hides some horrible sin or secret in his past. He is characterized by proud individualism, and rejects the conventional moral rules of society.

He is an outsider, isolated and attractive at the same time. He is of noble birth, but wild in his manners.

His looks are hard but handsome, and he has a great sensibility to nature and beauty.

Women cannot resist him, but he refuses his love. Men either admire him or envy him.
