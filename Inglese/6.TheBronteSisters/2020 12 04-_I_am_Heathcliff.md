# 4 dic 2020 - I am Heathcliff
::p. 65::
In this part the narrator is Nelly Dean.
This passage is a sort of climax and a turning point in the story, for many reasons:
1. it strips out the kind of love that binds Catherine and Heathcliff, which is an uncontrollable love, that is beyond the limits of human understanding
2. it is based on a misunderstanding: Nelly Dean and Catherine are talking, and Catherine is opening her heart to the servant, and paradoxically and while she is listing the reasons why she is going to marry Edgar Lington, she fully reveals her love for Heathcliff. Heathcliff is eavesdropping the conversation but he doesn’t listen to the whole conversation, but only to the part in which she say why she couldn’t marry Heathcliff, and than he leaves on a misunderstanding
3. this is a turning point, since from now on Catherine falls ill for a long time, she nearly dies for heartbreak and she recovers and marries Edgar

::The first section, from line 1 to 55::
Catherine explains the reasons why she has decided to marry Edgar Linton: the reasons are underlined in pink; the words and phrases related to Catherine’s behavior are highlighted in pink. They denote an highly sensitive and emotional nature.

The reasons for marrying Edgar are the classical reasons for marrying a man; as Catherine goes on speaking, we realize her real motivations she is concerned with Heathcliff’s present condition of servitude due to her brother’s treatment of him. The real reason underneath the decision of marrying Edgar is to protect Heathcliff from her brother’s violence. Acquiring a higher social status, Catherine might help Heathcliff to improve his present conditions.

The words highlighted in light blue describes Nelly’s attitude: they are very rational and pragmatic; she encourages Catherine to reflects on the reasons and consequences of her choice .

::The second section, from line 56 to 93::
* There is Catherine dream: she tells a dream to Nelly Dean.
* Nelly is aware and conscious of Heathcliff presence outside the door, but Catherine is not. The confession starts.
* Catherine says that she loves Heathcliff’s and she compares the two men, with words related to heat and cold. The words referred to Edgar are cold, while Heathcliff lightning and fire.

::The third section, from line 94 to the end::
Here it’s dealt Catherine’s love for Heathcliff.
* At line 119 there is why she marries Edgar: “If I marry Linton,, I can aid Heathcliff to rise, and place him out of my brother’s power”

Catherine says she is a part of Heathcliff, she feels his pains, if he didn’t exist she wouldn’t have a reason to live. Their love seems to have nothing to do with sexual attraction or physical desire.
Their relationship is one of the soul, it is eternal and unchangeable, their love is concerned with the metaphysical and the impersonal.
The love’s nature is religious, not only in its mystiques but in the awareness of the incompleteness of all the elements that makes up human nature.
It’s absolute, romantic, intense and passionate.

## Plot
Catherine speaks to Nelly in the kitchen. Neither of them is aware at first that Heathcliff is listening to their conversation. Catherine tells Nelly about Edgar’s marriage proposal and that she accepted. Nelly asks her if and why she loves Edgar, and she replies she does for a variety fo material reasons: he is rich, handsome and respectable. Nelly disapproves, and Catherine admits that she is doing the wrong thing. Then she tells Nelly that she had a dream in which she went to heaven and was unhappy there because she missed Wuthering Heights. She compares her marriage to Linton to being in heaven. She explains that, although she loves Heathcliff very much, she cannot marry him because Hindley has degraded him too much and she would be degraded too. Heathcliff leaves the room full of shame, humiliation and despair, and so he is not present to hear Catherine say that she loves him more deeply than anything else in the world.
Nelly emphasizes that Heathcliff would be deserted if she marries Linton, and Catherine indignantly replies that she is not going to desert Heathcliff, but will use her influence to raise him up in society She adds that they are such kindred spirits that they are the same person.
