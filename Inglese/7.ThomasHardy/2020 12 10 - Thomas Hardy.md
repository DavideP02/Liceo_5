# 10 dic 2020 - Thomas Hardy

==p. 97==

## Life
Thomas Hardy was born of humble parents at Higher Bockhampton, near Dorchester, in June 1840. As a boy he learned to play the violin, and he always loved music and dancing. He was also a voracious reader. When he left school in 1856, he was apprenticed to a local architect and church restorer. By 1862 he was working and studying architecture in London, and he began to write poetry. He also read the works of Comte, Mill, Darwin and Schopenhauer. In 1872 he published a novel, _Under the Greenwood Tree_, but he gained fame thanks to _Far from the Madding Crowd_, which appeared in serial form throughout 1874 in the monthly issues of _The Cornhill Magazine_. After this success he devoted his life to writing. His second great work of fiction was _The Return of the Native_, followed by a sequence of four remarkable tragic novels: _The Mayor of Casterbridge_, _The Woodlanders_, _Tess of the D'Urbervilles_ and his last one, _Jude the Obscure_.
This book scandalized Victorian public opinion with its pessimism and immorality; one copy was even burnt publicly by a bishop. After publishing _Wessex poems_, Hardy decided to give up fiction and turn to poetry. He died in 1928.

## Features

The production is large, he wrote a lot of novels: he is called a **late victorian novelist**, and he was a prolific writer.
He has been defined a
* pessimist
* realist
* romantic
* naturalist
* **regionalist**

His regionalism is strictly connected to the limited area where he set his novels, which he called _Wessex_

In anglosasson time, ==Wessex== was one of the seven kingdoms established in Britain: originally it covered the south western part of the country, between the Times and the south coast. It's the present Dorsetshire.

Hardy justify the adoption of the word Wessex by the need to give territorial definition to his novels. Wessex became the unifying element and a link between past and present, proving the ideal setting for novels whose major theme was the transformation of an agricultural society under the impact of modern industrial life.

This total immersion in ==nature==, together with a belief that only in rural life can man fully express their passions, makes Hardy in some respect a **romantic writer**.
While for the romantic nature usually meant joy and consolation for Hardy it was a hostile power, indifferent to men's destiny.

==Love==, which is present in all novels it is an other _romantic theme_, quiet often finishes in disillusion and failure, destroyed by institutions like **marriage** or by **society**, or by chance.

He was quite pessimistic, but his ==pessimism== was linked to the intellectual and scientific movement of the time, and to his studies of Darwin and Mills. His **religious faith** disappeared, and he rejected Cristian Faith and _the Bible_. He worked out a pessimistic theory according to which man is an insignificant object in a universe which is _indifferent to him_. Man is a **powerless victim** of an _obscure faith_, which shows its workings in a series of accidents and coincidences.

This fatalistic determinism seemed to deprive man of all responsibilities for his actions. Hardy elaborated the idea of a kind of ==predestination==, quite often a predestination to failure, according to which all men fulfill their destiny with no help from society, which oppresses and destroys them, or from love, which usually leads to unhappiness

Hardy felt compassion for suffering people, and for all living creatures. His ==characters== although failing when they try to improve themselves, maintain a dignity of their own. Around them, moves the community, made of people unable to provide help.

The ==tenchnique== he uses is architectural and cinematic: he was very good at _givig unity_ to his novels, although the plots are not always convincing because of certain melodramatic episodes and coincidences. It is **cinematic** because it starts with a panoramic effect and until he provides a close-up on a single detail.
