# 7 gen 2021 - Thomas Hardy

## Tess D'Urberville

This novel has a subtitle, that is

        A Pure Woman Faithfully Presented

With this subtitle Hardy wanted to say that a woman forced by circumstances to submit to violence and to use violence can still be ==pure==. Although she has used and received violence, she can still be called pure, in her heart. This was an open challenge to the moral conventions of the time. In the victorian age, women were Angels or a Whores. There was no possibility in the middle. By saying she is a pure woman, he challenged the moral conventions of the time.

We must say that the ==inner structure== of the novel is formed by conflicts and antagonism; for example _prejudice_ is opposed to _feelings_, _culture_ vs _ignorance_, _individual_ vs _community_ and _human will_ vs _destiny_. All the novel is built around these opposites.

The idea that underlies the whole novel is that ==man is the victim== of the decisions and choices forced on him by predestination. We are born and our destiny is already predetermined.

This was very well said in ==Macbeth==: in the end there is _A tale told by an idiot_, in which Macbeth says that choosing in life is just an illusion, but everything is already predetermined, and every step we take in a direction with the illusion of choosing freely leads us exactly towards the goal that a Might-being or God, or fate or chance had predetermined for us. Shakespeare says that man is given the illusion to choose but actually he is just a puppet in the hands of his destiny.

The conclusion of the novel is tragic and melodramatic and the ==plot== is imbued with fatalism and pessimism.

### Plot
* ==p. 99==

John Durbeyfield, a peddler who lives in the village of **Marlott**, discovers he is a descendent of a rich and aristocratic family, the D'Urbervilles. His family has already fallen on hard times and the situation gets worse when their horse, which is their only means of sustenance, dies. Thereforse his eldest daughter Tess is persuaded to go to the village of **Trantridge** and to start working as a poultry maid on the D'Urberville estate. She resists her master Alec's attempts to seduce her. Finally he takes advantage of her in the woods one night after a fair. Later she finds herself pregnant. She returns to her village and gives birth to a baby boy who died soon after. She leaves her father's house and goes to a distant valley, where she accepts a job as a milkmaid at **Talboathays Dairy** in a rich agricultural region of southern England. There she meets Angel Clare, a clergyman's son who is interested in new farming methods. They fall in love but Tess feels she should tell Angel about her past. She writes him a confessional note and slips it under his door, but it slides under the carpet and Angel never sees it. They get married but when, on their wedding night, Tess tells Angel about her past, he leaves her and goes to Brazil.
She bears great sufferings and hardship and is forced to take a job at **Flintcombe Ash**, a barren region where she works in the fields in winter. She hears a wandering preacher speak and discovers that he is Alec D'Urberville, who has been converted to Christianity by Angel's father, Reverend Clare. Tess finally agree to become Alec's mistress and lives in the seaside resort of Sandbourne. Angel comes back from Brazil, finds her and tells her he has forgiven her.
Out of despair, Tess kills Alec and flees with Angel. She is arrested at **Stonehenge** while she is sleeping on the sone of sacrifice, and she is finally executed.

### Themes

1. **Nature** is a coprotagonist but it is indifferent to men's destiny (as Leopardi says)
2. **Influence of social laws** and conventions on the individual. Hardy says that the life of an individual, of a human being follows the same pattern *as* all natural things, so it is subjected to growth and decay. It has a short season of joy than it falls into despair. In this specific case Tess is a particular specimen of woman: she wishes to live despite the wounds that life has inflicted on her. She she is continuously regenerated; she dies in herself and than she reborns.
3. **Society and morality** contrasted to the **indifference of nature**.
4. **Chance** (anche detto _hap_). Tess' destiny is determined by the combination of several factors.
    1. It is inherent in her condition of human being, and brings with itself the inevitability of sufference and death
    2. Pressure of social forces that determine the future of a person from birth. These conditions are
        * **sex**: she is a female. As a woman of her times she inherits the tendency to accept other people's will *passively*, and she will be destroyed because of this.
        * **family**: she was born from a very poor family
        * **beauty**: she is born extremely beautiful; nowadays it is something positive, but for Tess this is a bad omen
        * **causal circumstances** contribute to the building of her destiny: for example the death of her father horse, which is the only wealth of the family, and the letter not read by Angel before their wedding
5. **Religion**, which is very important. Hardy refuses christianity, so Angel refuses the christian faith of his family because it can no longer answer to the needs of modern man. Only the primitive worship of nature, for example the celebration of druids in Stonehenge (considered the temple of the sun), seems to find an inner response in the heart of unsophisticated and innocente creatures like Tess.
6. **Progress**. Hardy believes that the rural countryside shouldn't be spoilt by the effects of industrialization; for example the life of the village where Tess lives is upset by the arrival of the railway.
