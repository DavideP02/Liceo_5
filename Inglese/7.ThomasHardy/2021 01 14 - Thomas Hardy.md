## Tess's baby
* ==p. 104==

After the seduction the ==relationship== goes on, and he visits her bedroom every night; he seems to be in love with her: she is his mistress.

Tess gets ==pregnant== and she decides to leave the farm; she never says anything to Alec, and he doesn't know she is pregnant.

She keeps her ==child== with her and goes to work to the field: this is a very hard work, much harder than in Alec's farm. She is only interested in her child: the baby has never been baptized, because she had him outside the marriage.

When the child is three years old she left him to the care of her family to go to work; the baby ==falls ill==, and her family is unable to look after him. They let him **die**, also because he was a burden. She has to **bury him**.

She goes to the priest and asks him to ==baptize== the baby before burying him, since unbaptized children go to hell, and she is worried. The vicar tells her that he is not going to baptize the child, so she decides to baptize the child herself.

The parson experiment a ==conflict== between his feeling and his nature **as a man** and his duties as a **clergyman**.

Hardy wants to underline that ==religion== is **no longer capable** of fulfilling the needs of modern man, because rules are too strict.

The passage can be divided into four parts:

**From line 1 to 16**: there is the baptism: Tess performs the ceremony by herself with her brothers and sisters, and call the baby Sorrow. This baptism is a baptism for Tess as well, and marks a new sense-worth she lacked.

**From line 17 to 25**: the description of Sorrow's death and the obtrusive narrator's comments on his unlucky and short life. In this part there is also the contrast between Sorrow's short and meaningless life and the eternity and vastity of the universe, and also the contrast between the baby's existence and the refusal opposed by society.

**From line 26 to 58**: here there is Tess and the Vicar; she asks him if the baby has the right to be buried in holy ground, in the cemetery.

**From line 59 to the end**: the baby is finally buried in a forgotten part of the churchyard among the unbaptized, the drunkard and the suicides: the damned.

Tess is making a crusade against society.
