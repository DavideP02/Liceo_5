# 15 gen 2020 - Thomas Hardy

## Little Father Time
* ==p. 107-108==

### First part: 1-15

**Jude's discovery of the little corpses.**

Hardy uses a ==cinematic tecnique==. Jude is virtually converted into a camera focusing on the main object followed by details. This is highlighted in yellow

There is ==Jude's== immediate ==reaction== to the scene (highlighted in purple). There is a very fast rhythm

### Second part: 16-31

**Sue's despair**

==Her reactions== are opposite to Jude's in the sense that she breaks down and cannot find consolation (highlighted in green).

### Third part: 32-50

**Doctor's explanation**

It is not technical: he describes the features of the last generation; ==children have no hope==; the have been deprived of the faith in the future and in progress, and of the wish to live.

Unlike ==Dickens's children==, who suffer hardship, misery, exploitation but always maintain their wish to live, and to improve their miserable condition thanks to their qualities, Hardy's children have no hope.

==Hardy's children== have no hope, because they have been deprived of an optimistic vision of life.

The lines highlighted in light blue are the ==reasons== for Little Father choice of ==suicide==; they are related to Sue's and Jude's mistakes. Little Father has acted out of despair; he had been told the previous night that Sue was pregnant again.

### Fourth part: 51-86

**Sue's and Jude's attempts to find an explanation**

The have two completely different ==reactions==. **Jude** thinks chance has acted against them, and he thinks they can together overcame difficulties; hope is symbolized by the baby that is going to be born: a new family and a new life. **Sue** thinks their union has been shadowed by Death; she thinks their perfect union has been stained with blood and therefore it is ruined.

These different reactions will lead them ==to part==. Sue is characterized by the sense of guilt, which is due to the strict moral code of the victorian society. **Victorian society** considers their relationship obscene, while the **Church** condemns them as sinners and doesn't recognize their sorrow. *Once more religion is unable to help*.

Sentences underlined in blue contain an ironical description of ==God's love== for his people. It is ironical because actually Hardy wants to say that God has completely forgotten Jude and Sue and their needs.

After this novel Hardy's editor asked him not to write anymore novels since they were too pessimistic. He tried his hand to write poems, but they were as pessimistic and as dramatic as his novels
