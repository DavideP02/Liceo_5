# Thomas Hardy

## Life
Thomas Hardy was born of humble parents at Higher Bockhampton, near Dorchester, in June 1840. As a boy he learned to play the violin, and he always loved music and dancing. He was also a voracious reader. When he left school in 1856, he was apprenticed to a local architect and church restorer. By 1862 he was working and studying architecture in London, and he began to write poetry. He also read the works of Comte, Mill, Darwin and Schopenhauer. In 1872 he published a novel, _Under the Greenwood Tree_, but he gained fame thanks to _Far from the Madding Crowd_, which appeared in serial form throughout 1874 in the monthly issues of _The Cornhill Magazine_. After this success he devoted his life to writing. His second great work of fiction was _The Return of the Native_, followed by a sequence of four remarkable tragic novels: _The Mayor of Casterbridge_, _The Woodlanders_, _Tess of the D'Urbervilles_ and his last one, _Jude the Obscure_.
This book scandalized Victorian public opinion with its pessimism and immorality; one copy was even burnt publicly by a bishop. After publishing _Wessex poems_, Hardy decided to give up fiction and turn to poetry. He died in 1928.

## Features

The production is large, he wrote a lot of novels: he is called a **late victorian novelist**, and he was a prolific writer.
He has been defined a
* pessimist
* realist
* romantic
* naturalist
* **regionalist**

His regionalism is strictly connected to the limited area where he set his novels, which he called _Wessex_

In anglosasson time, ==Wessex== was one of the seven kingdoms established in Britain: originally it covered the south western part of the country, between the Times and the south coast. It's the present Dorsetshire.

Hardy justify the adoption of the word Wessex by the need to give territorial definition to his novels. Wessex became the unifying element and a link between past and present, proving the ideal setting for novels whose major theme was the transformation of an agricultural society under the impact of modern industrial life.

This total immersion in ==nature==, together with a belief that only in rural life can man fully express their passions, makes Hardy in some respect a **romantic writer**.
While for the romantic nature usually meant joy and consolation for Hardy it was a hostile power, indifferent to men's destiny.

==Love==, which is present in all novels it is an other _romantic theme_, quiet often finishes in disillusion and failure, destroyed by institutions like **marriage** or by **society**, or by chance.

He was quite pessimistic, but his ==pessimism== was linked to the intellectual and scientific movement of the time, and to his studies of Darwin and Mills. His **religious faith** disappeared, and he rejected Cristian Faith and _the Bible_. He worked out a pessimistic theory according to which man is an insignificant object in a universe which is _indifferent to him_. Man is a **powerless victim** of an _obscure faith_, which shows its workings in a series of accidents and coincidences.

This fatalistic determinism seemed to deprive man of all responsibilities for his actions. Hardy elaborated the idea of a kind of ==predestination==, quite often a predestination to failure, according to which all men fulfill their destiny with no help from society, which oppresses and destroys them, or from love, which usually leads to unhappiness

Hardy felt compassion for suffering people, and for all living creatures. His ==characters== although failing when they try to improve themselves, maintain a dignity of their own. Around them, moves the community, made of people unable to provide help.

The ==tenchnique== he uses is architectural and cinematic: he was very good at _givig unity_ to his novels, although the plots are not always convincing because of certain melodramatic episodes and coincidences. It is **cinematic** because it starts with a panoramic effect and until he provides a close-up on a single detail.

## ==Novel==: Tess D'Urberville

This novel has a subtitle, that is

        A Pure Woman Faithfully Presented

With this subtitle Hardy wanted to say that a woman forced by circumstances to submit to violence and to use violence can still be ==pure==. Although she has used and received violence, she can still be called pure, in her heart. This was an open challenge to the moral conventions of the time. In the victorian age, women were Angels or a Whores. There was no possibility in the middle. By saying she is a pure woman, he challenged the moral conventions of the time.

We must say that the ==inner structure== of the novel is formed by conflicts and antagonism; for example _prejudice_ is opposed to _feelings_, _culture_ vs _ignorance_, _individual_ vs _community_ and _human will_ vs _destiny_. All the novel is built around these opposites.

The idea that underlies the whole novel is that ==man is the victim== of the decisions and choices forced on him by predestination. We are born and our destiny is already predetermined.

This was very well said in ==Macbeth==: in the end there is _A tale told by an idiot_, in which Macbeth says that choosing in life is just an illusion, but everything is already predetermined, and every step we take in a direction with the illusion of choosing freely leads us exactly towards the goal that a Might-being or God, or fate or chance had predetermined for us. Shakespeare says that man is given the illusion to choose but actually he is just a puppet in the hands of his destiny.

The conclusion of the novel is tragic and melodramatic and the ==plot== is imbued with fatalism and pessimism.

### Plot
* ==p. 99==

John Durbeyfield, a peddler who lives in the village of **Marlott**, discovers he is a descendent of a rich and aristocratic family, the D'Urbervilles. His family has already fallen on hard times and the situation gets worse when their horse, which is their only means of sustenance, dies. Thereforse his eldest daughter Tess is persuaded to go to the village of **Trantridge** and to start working as a poultry maid on the D'Urberville estate. She resists her master Alec's attempts to seduce her. Finally he takes advantage of her in the woods one night after a fair. Later she finds herself pregnant. She returns to her village and gives birth to a baby boy who died soon after. She leaves her father's house and goes to a distant valley, where she accepts a job as a milkmaid at **Talboathays Dairy** in a rich agricultural region of southern England. There she meets Angel Clare, a clergyman's son who is interested in new farming methods. They fall in love but Tess feels she should tell Angel about her past. She writes him a confessional note and slips it under his door, but it slides under the carpet and Angel never sees it. They get married but when, on their wedding night, Tess tells Angel about her past, he leaves her and goes to Brazil.
She bears great sufferings and hardship and is forced to take a job at **Flintcombe Ash**, a barren region where she works in the fields in winter. She hears a wandering preacher speak and discovers that he is Alec D'Urberville, who has been converted to Christianity by Angel's father, Reverend Clare. Tess finally agree to become Alec's mistress and lives in the seaside resort of Sandbourne. Angel comes back from Brazil, finds her and tells her he has forgiven her.
Out of despair, Tess kills Alec and flees with Angel. She is arrested at **Stonehenge** while she is sleeping on the sone of sacrifice, and she is finally executed.

### Themes

1. **Nature** is a coprotagonist but it is indifferent to men's destiny (as Leopardi says)
2. **Influence of social laws** and conventions on the individual. Hardy says that the life of an individual, of a human being follows the same pattern *as* all natural things, so it is subjected to growth and decay. It has a short season of joy than it falls into despair. In this specific case Tess is a particular specimen of woman: she wishes to live despite the wounds that life has inflicted on her. She she is continuously regenerated; she dies in herself and than she reborns.
3. **Society and morality** contrasted to the **indifference of nature**.
4. **Chance** (anche detto _hap_). Tess' destiny is determined by the combination of several factors.
    1. It is inherent in her condition of human being, and brings with itself the inevitability of sufference and death
    2. Pressure of social forces that determine the future of a person from birth. These conditions are
        * **sex**: she is a female. As a woman of her times she inherits the tendency to accept other people's will *passively*, and she will be destroyed because of this.
        * **family**: she was born from a very poor family
        * **beauty**: she is born extremely beautiful; nowadays it is something positive, but for Tess this is a bad omen
        * **causal circumstances** contribute to the building of her destiny: for example the death of her father horse, which is the only wealth of the family, and the letter not read by Angel before their wedding
5. **Religion**, which is very important. Hardy refuses christianity, so Angel refuses the christian faith of his family because it can no longer answer to the needs of modern man. Only the primitive worship of nature, for example the celebration of druids in Stonehenge (considered the temple of the sun), seems to find an inner response in the heart of unsophisticated and innocente creatures like Tess.
6. **Progress**. Hardy believes that the rural countryside shouldn't be spoilt by the effects of industrialization; for example the life of the village where Tess lives is upset by the arrival of the railway.

### T: Alec and Tess
* ==p. 100==

==Tess's father=='s horse has died, and her father has discovered that his family belongs to a branch of the D'Urbervilles family, and that he has some rich relatives. The "D" in front of the name is like "von". Tess's family is poor, and they are fallen, and they have no more privileges. He discovers that he has rich relatives. He is a very low character, he drinks a lot and is very violent, and moreover he continuously bear children, and they are a big family

When the horse die, he sends his elder daughter to ==work in the farm== of this rich relative, but unfortunately here there is an older cousin. Her father expect her to work in the farm, with a good activity, but instead she becomes a poultry maid, but from the very beginning Alec wants to seduce her, since she is extremely beautiful

The ==first occasion== takes place one night, it is September evening, and she is coming back from the farm on foot. She is an outcast in the group of workers, because the girls think she is too beautiful and they are envious. The boys all wants to seduce her, and she refuses them. So she is isolated. By chance (and chance is always present) Alec, coming with his horse, asks her if she wants a lift. She accept, since she is very tired and because the others don't want her, and also because it is also an act of submission to someone much richer. Alec and Tess ride through the forest and at certain moment she realizes that he has taken the wrong turn, but it is too late.

#### First part: 1-45

> She was silent, and the horse ambled along for a considerable distance, till a faint luminous fog, which had hung in the hollows all the evening, became general and enveloped them. It seemed to hold the moonlight in suspension, rendering it more pervasive than in clear air. Whether on this account, or from absent-mindedness, or from sleepiness, she did not perceive that they had long ago passed the point at which the lane to Trantridge branched from the highway, and that her conductor had not taken the Trantridge track.
>
>She was inexpressibly weary. [...] Only once, however, was she overcome by actual drowsiness. In that moment of oblivion her head sank gently against him.
>
>D’Urberville stopped the horse, withdrew his feet from the stirrups, turned sideways on the saddle, and enclosed her waist with his arm to support her.
>
>This immediately put her on the defensive, and with one of those sudden impulses of reprisal to which she was liable she gave him a little push from her. In his ticklish position he nearly lost his balance and only just avoided rolling over into the road, the horse, though a powerful one, being fortunately the quietest he rode.
>
>“That is devilish unkind!” he said. “I mean no harm—only to keep you from falling.”
>
>She pondered suspiciously, till, thinking that this might after all be true, she relented, and said quite humbly, “I beg your pardon, sir.”
>
>“I won’t pardon you unless you show some confidence in me. Good God!” he burst out, “what am I, to be repulsed so by a mere chit like you? For near three mortal months have you trifled with my feelings, eluded me, and snubbed me; and I won’t stand it!”
>
>“I’ll leave you to-morrow, sir.”
>
>“No, you will not leave me to-morrow! Will you, I ask once more, show your belief in me by letting me clasp you with my arm? Come, between us two and nobody else, now. We know each other well; and you know that I love you, and think you the prettiest girl in the world, which you are. Mayn’t I treat you as a lover?”
>
>She drew a quick pettish breath of objection, writhing uneasily on her seat, looked far ahead, and murmured, “I don’t know—I wish—how can I say yes or no when—”
>
>He settled the matter by clasping his arm round her as he desired, and Tess expressed no further negative. Thus they sidled slowly onward till it struck her they had been advancing for an unconscionable time—far longer than was usually occupied by the short journey from Chaseborough, even at this walking pace, and that they were no longer on hard road, but in a mere trackway.
>
>“Why, where be we?” she exclaimed.
>
>“Passing by a wood.”
>
>“A wood—what wood? Surely we are quite out of the road?”
>
>“A bit of The Chase—the oldest wood in England. It is a lovely night, and why should we not prolong our ride a little?”
>
>“How could you be so treacherous!” said Tess, between archness and real dismay, and getting rid of his arm by pulling open his fingers one by one, though at the risk of slipping off herself. “Just when I’ve been putting such trust in you, and obliging you to please you, because I thought I had wronged you by that push! Please set me down, and let me walk home.”
>
>“You cannot walk home, darling, even if the air were clear. We are miles away from Trantridge, if I must tell you, and in this growing fog you might wander for hours among these trees.”

It is shown different stages of mind she is going through
1. absent mindedness
2. weariness
3. uneasiness
4. indignation
5. embarassment

During the ride ==Alec takes advantage== of his position, in the sense that he makes advances to her: he keeps her close to him and he's very tender and affectionate. Tess is not in the position to reject Alec advances, and she even feels guilty for her treatment of him, because he is her master and she will discover that he has been giving her family some gifts:
* an horse for her father
* toys for the children

Alec and Tess ride the horse in close ==proximity==, and this is an anticipation of the sexual act. She has a moment of oblivion, a moment in which she is not able to act consciously, and he goes deeper into the forest, and then she get angry.
When she realizes this, she wants to go home, but he denies this. He promises her he will go up the hill in order to understand where they are.
They stop in a place and he prepares a nest for her. He goes away up the hill.

#### Second part: 45-105

>“Never mind that,” she coaxed. “Put me down, I beg you. I don’t mind where it is; only let me get down, sir, please!”
>
>“Very well, then, I will—on one condition. Having brought you here to this out-of-the-way place, I feel myself responsible for your safe-conduct home, whatever you may yourself feel about it. As to your getting to Trantridge without assistance, it is quite impossible; for, to tell the truth, dear, owing to this fog, which so disguises everything, I don’t quite know where we are myself. Now, if you will promise to wait beside the horse while I walk through the bushes till I come to some road or house, and ascertain exactly our whereabouts, I’ll deposit you here willingly. When I come back I’ll give you full directions, and if you insist upon walking you may; or you may ride—at your pleasure.”
>
>She accepted these terms, and slid off on the near side, though not till he had stolen a cursory kiss. He sprang down on the other side.
>
>“I suppose I must hold the horse?” said she.
>
>“Oh no; it’s not necessary,” replied Alec, patting the panting creature. “He’s had enough of it for to-night.”
>
>He turned the horse’s head into the bushes, hitched him on to a bough, and made a sort of couch or nest for her in the deep mass of dead leaves.
>
>“Now, you sit there,” he said. “The leaves have not got damp as yet. Just give an eye to the horse—it will be quite sufficient.”
>
>He took a few steps away from her, but, returning, said, “By the bye, Tess, your father has a new cob to-day. Somebody gave it to him.”
>
>“Somebody? You!”
>
>D’Urberville nodded.
>
>“O how very good of you that is!” she exclaimed, with a painful sense of the awkwardness of having to thank him just then.
>
>“And the children have some toys.”
>
>“I didn’t know—you ever sent them anything!” she murmured, much moved. “I almost wish you had not—yes, I almost wish it!”
>
>“Why, dear?”
>
>“It—hampers me so.”
>
>“Tessy—don’t you love me ever so little now?”
>
>“I’m grateful,” she reluctantly admitted. “But I fear I do not—” The sudden vision of his passion for herself as a factor in this result so distressed her that, beginning with one slow tear, and then following with another, she wept outright.
>
>“Don’t cry, dear, dear one! Now sit down here, and wait till I come.” She passively sat down amid the leaves he had heaped, and shivered slightly. “Are you cold?” he asked.
>
>“Not very—a little.”
>
>He touched her with his fingers, which sank into her as into down. “You have only that puffy muslin dress on—how’s that?”
>
>“It’s my best summer one. ’Twas very warm when I started, and I didn’t know I was going to ride, and that it would be night.”
>
>“Nights grow chilly in September. Let me see.” He pulled off a light overcoat that he had worn, and put it round her tenderly. “That’s it—now you’ll feel warmer,” he continued. “Now, my pretty, rest there; I shall soon be back again.”
>
>Having buttoned the overcoat round her shoulders he plunged into the webs of vapour which by this time formed veils between the trees. She could hear the rustling of the branches as he ascended the adjoining slope, till his movements were no louder than the hopping of a bird, and finally died away. With the setting of the moon the pale light lessened, and Tess became invisible as she fell into reverie upon the leaves where he had left her.
>
>In the meantime Alec d’Urberville had pushed on up the slope to clear his genuine doubt as to the quarter of The Chase they were in. He had, in fact, ridden quite at random for over an hour, taking any turning that came to hand in order to prolong companionship with her, and giving far more attention to Tess’s moonlit person than to any wayside object. A little rest for the jaded animal being desirable, he did not hasten his search for landmarks. A clamber over the hill into the adjoining vale brought him to the fence of a highway whose contours he recognized, which settled the question of their whereabouts. D’Urberville thereupon turned back; but by this time the moon had quite gone down, and partly on account of the fog The Chase was wrapped in thick darkness, although morning was not far off. He was obliged to advance with outstretched hands to avoid contact with the boughs, and discovered that to hit the exact spot from which he had started was at first entirely beyond him. Roaming up and down, round and round, he at length heard a slight movement of the horse close at hand; and the sleeve of his overcoat unexpectedly caught his foot.
>
>“Tess!” said d’Urberville.
>
>There was no answer. The obscurity was now so great that he could see absolutely nothing but a pale nebulousness at his feet, which represented the white muslin figure he had left upon the dead leaves. Everything else was blackness alike. D’Urberville stooped; and heard a gentle regular breathing. He knelt and bent lower, till her breath warmed his face, and in a moment his cheek was in contact with hers. She was sleeping soundly, and upon her eyelashes there lingered tears.

Tess experiences more states of mind:
1. distress
2. helplessness

What makes us understand that she is a _victorian girl_ is that she doesn't leave when he goes away. She would have the possibility to get up and run away; every clever girl would have understood what his purpose was, and would have gone away.

> She passively sat down amid the leaves he had heaped, and shivered slightly

* This part highlights the most important trait of Tess's character, which is ==passivity==: she is passive to the will of a man and of a master.

There is an other symbol: ==Tess's muslin dress== which represents her fragile innocence.

The ==fog== is the symbol of Alec behavior: Alec is not behaving in a clear decorous way. He gets back and he is able to find her because of the colour of the dress.

> She was sleeping soundly, and upon her eyelashes there lingered tears.
* She was sleeping and there were tears on her face; we get to know that she had cried because she knew what was going to happen, and the tears were still on her eyelashes.

#### Third part: 106-125

> Darkness and silence ruled everywhere around. Above them rose the primaeval yews and oaks of The Chase, in which there poised gentle roosting birds in their last nap; and about them stole the hopping rabbits and hares. But, might some say, where was Tess’s guardian angel? where was the providence of her simple faith? Perhaps, like that other god of whom the ironical Tishbite spoke, he was talking, or he was pursuing, or he was in a journey, or he was sleeping and not to be awaked.

* many details of the wood are shown, which make us understand that nature is indifferent and society does not wish to know or understand.
* The ==act of seduction== is not described, but we get to know that it has taken place, because Hardy talks about Tess's guardian angel, which was absent: this denies the possibility of relying on religion

>Why it was that upon this beautiful feminine tissue, sensitive as gossamer, and practically blank as snow as yet, there should have been traced such a coarse pattern as it was doomed to receive; why so often the coarse appropriates the finer thus, the wrong man the woman, the wrong woman the man, many thousand years of analytical philosophy have failed to explain to our sense of order. One may, indeed, admit the possibility of a retribution lurking in the present catastrophe. Doubtless some of Tess d’Urberville’s mailed ancestors rollicking home from a fray had dealt the same measure even more ruthlessly towards peasant girls of their time. But though to visit the sins of the fathers upon the children may be a morality good enough for divinities, it is scorned by average human nature; and it therefore does not mend the matter.
>
>As Tess’s own people down in those retreats are never tired of saying among each other in their fatalistic way: “It was to be.” There lay the pity of it. An immeasurable social chasm was to divide our heroine’s personality thereafter from that previous self of hers who stepped from her mother’s door to try her fortune at Trantridge poultry-farm.

The narrator addresses the reader directly, and he makes this by putting the activities of the human being into the contest of nature and of supernatural power. He talks about the birds and animals in the wood going about their business, than he considers that the past affects the present. He states that man's life is regulated by **chance**.

> An immeasurable social chasm
* makes reference that Tess and Alec came from two different social classes, and that their relationship is not acceptable to either classes, moreover it is the woman who pays the price of the lost of reputation: she is a fallen woman. From this moment on she will no longer be simple and joyful, but will have a darker side to her personality.

==Tess is not responsible== and Hardy always presents her as a victim

### T: Tess's baby
* ==p. 104==

After the seduction the ==relationship== goes on, and he visits her bedroom every night; he seems to be in love with her: she is his mistress.

Tess gets ==pregnant== and she decides to leave the farm; she never says anything to Alec, and he doesn't know she is pregnant.

She keeps her ==child== with her and goes to work to the field: this is a very hard work, much harder than in Alec's farm. She is only interested in her child: the baby has never been baptized, because she had him outside the marriage.

When the child is three years old she left him to the care of her family to go to work; the baby ==falls ill==, and her family is unable to look after him. They let him **die**, also because he was a burden. She has to **bury him**.

She goes to the priest and asks him to ==baptize== the baby before burying him, since unbaptized children go to hell, and she is worried. The vicar tells her that he is not going to baptize the child, so she decides to baptize the child herself.

The parson experiment a ==conflict== between his feeling and his nature **as a man** and his duties as a **clergyman**.

Hardy wants to underline that ==religion== is **no longer capable** of fulfilling the needs of modern man, because rules are too strict.

The passage can be divided into four parts:

#### First part: 1-16

>“Be you really going to christen him, Tess?”
>
>The girl-mother replied in a grave affirmative.
>
>“What’s his name going to be?”
>
>She had not thought of that, but a name suggested by a phrase in the book of Genesis came into her head as she proceeded with the baptismal service, and now she pronounced it:
>
>“SORROW, I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.”
>
>She sprinkled the water, and there was silence.
>
>“Say ‘Amen,’ children.”
>
>The tiny voices piped in obedient response, “Amen!”
>
>Tess went on:
>
>“We receive this child”—and so forth—“and do sign him with the sign of the Cross.”
>
>Here she dipped her hand into the basin, and fervently drew an immense cross upon the baby with her forefinger, continuing with the customary sentences as to his manfully fighting against sin, the world, and the devil, and being a faithful soldier and servant unto his life’s end. She duly went on with the Lord’s Prayer, the children lisping it after her in a thin gnat-like wail, till, at the conclusion, raising their voices to clerk’s pitch, they again piped into silence, “Amen!” [...]

There is the baptism: Tess performs the ceremony by herself with her brothers and sisters, and call the baby Sorrow. This baptism is a baptism for Tess as well, and marks a new sense-worth she lacked.

#### Second part: 17-25

>Poor Sorrow’s campaign against sin, the world, and the devil was doomed to be of limited brilliancy—luckily perhaps for himself, considering his beginnings. In the blue of the morning that fragile soldier and servant breathed his last, and when the other children awoke they cried bitterly, and begged Sissy to have another pretty baby. [...]
>
>So passed away Sorrow the Undesired—that intrusive creature, that bastard gift of shameless Nature, who respects not the social law; a waif to whom eternal Time had been a matter of days merely, who knew not that such things as years and centuries ever were; to whom the cottage interior was the universe, the week’s weather climate, new-born babyhood human existence, and the instinct to suck human knowledge.

The description of Sorrow's death and the obtrusive narrator's comments on his unlucky and short life. In this part there is also the contrast between Sorrow's short and meaningless life and the eternity and vastity of the universe, and also the contrast between the baby's existence and the refusal opposed by society.

#### Third part: 26-58

>Tess, who mused on the christening a good deal, wondered if it were doctrinally sufficient to secure a Christian burial for the child. Nobody could tell this but the parson of the parish, and he was a new-comer, and did not know her. [...]
>
>“I should like to ask you something, sir.”
>
>He expressed his willingness to listen, and she told the story of the baby’s illness and the extemporized ordinance. “And now, sir,” she added earnestly, “can you tell me this—will it be just the same for him as if you had baptized him?”
>
>Having the natural feelings of a tradesman at finding that a job he should have been called in for had been unskilfully botched by his customers among themselves, he was disposed to say no. Yet the dignity of the girl, the strange tenderness in her voice, combined to affect his nobler impulses—or rather those that he had left in him after ten years of endeavour to graft technical belief on actual scepticism. The man and the ecclesiastic fought within him, and the victory fell to the man.
>
>“My dear girl,” he said, “it will be just the same.”
>
>“Then will you give him a Christian burial?” she asked quickly.
>
>The Vicar felt himself cornered. Hearing of the baby’s illness, he had conscientiously gone to the house after nightfall to perform the rite, and, unaware that the refusal to admit him had come from Tess’s father and not from Tess, he could not allow the plea of necessity for its irregular administration.
>
>“Ah—that’s another matter,” he said.
>
>“Another matter—why?” asked Tess, rather warmly.
>
>“Well—I would willingly do so if only we two were concerned. But I must not—for certain reasons.”
>
>“Just for once, sir!”
>
>“Really I must not.”
>
>“O sir!” She seized his hand as she spoke.
>
>He withdrew it, shaking his head.
>
>“Then I don’t like you!” she burst out, “and I’ll never come to your church no more!”
>
>“Don’t talk so rashly.”
>
>“Perhaps it will be just the same to him if you don’t?... Will it be just the same? Don’t for God’s sake speak as saint to sinner, but as you yourself to me myself—poor me!”
>
>How the Vicar reconciled his answer with the strict notions he supposed himself to hold on these subjects it is beyond a layman’s power to tell, though not to excuse. Somewhat moved, he said in this case also—
>
>“It will be just the same.”

Here there is Tess and the Vicar; she asks him if the baby has the right to be buried in holy ground, in the cemetery.

#### Fourth part: 59-68

>So the baby was carried in a small deal box, under an ancient woman’s shawl, to the churchyard that night, and buried by lantern-light, at the cost of a shilling and a pint of beer to the sexton, in that shabby corner of God’s allotment where He lets the nettles grow, and where all unbaptized infants, notorious drunkards, suicides, and others of the conjecturally damned are laid. In spite of the untoward surroundings, however, Tess bravely made a little cross of two laths and a piece of string, and having bound it with flowers, she stuck it up at the head of the grave one evening when she could enter the churchyard without being seen, putting at the foot also a bunch of the same flowers in a little jar of water to keep them alive. What matter was it that on the outside of the jar the eye of mere observation noted the words “Keelwell’s Marmalade”? The eye of maternal affection did not see them in its vision of higher things.

The baby is finally buried in a forgotten part of the churchyard among the unbaptized, the drunkard and the suicides: the damned.

Tess is making a crusade against society.

## ==Novel==: Jude the Obscure

### Plot

Jude Fawley, an orphan boy from a poor village, has ambitions to become a student at the University of Christminster, which Hardy modelled on Oxford with its beautiful colleges. Jude works as a stonemason and studies in his free time.
After his marriage to Arabella Donn ends disastrously, he moves to Christminster where he hopes to fulfil his dream and where he meets his cousin Sue Bridehead.
He arranges for her to work with the town schoolmaster, Richard Phillotson. She soon gets engaged to Phillotson and marries him After a while Sue and Jude meet again and he finds out that she is not happy in her marriage. They fall in love and decide to live together, but they refuse the institution of marriage. Sue takes in Jude's son, called Little Father Time, who was born from his first marriage, and bears Jude a son and a daughter.
This scandalous relationship provokes the disapproval of the narrow minded people of the university town. It is also subjected to the pressures of poverty because Jude loses his job. They cannot find lodging, so Sue and the children live in a room while Jude stays at a tavern. The climax is reached with the death of their children ( T78). Sue thinks that this is God's punishment for their relationship and goes back to Phillotson, while Jude lives with Arabella again but dies soon after.

### Settings

The novel is divided into six parts; each is set in a particular town or village.

**Part I** is set in Marygreen, where young Jude develops a passionate desire for a university education.
**Part II** is centred in Christminster, where Jude finds that access to university is impossible for a working-class man.
**Part III** takes place in Melchester, where Jude aims to study for the church, in the hope of entering a theological college. **Part IV** is staged in Shaston, where Sue asks Phillotson for her freedom and returns to Jude.
**Part V** is mainly set in Aldbrickham, where Sue and Jude finally agree to live together. They have to leave and move from one town to another, because of gossip and social disapproval.
**Part VI** marks the return to Christminster, where tragedy takes place.

### Themes

In the novel Hardy questions the **sanctity of marriage vows** and shows his interest in the issue of **divorce**. Another contemporary issue is that of higher education for the working class. Through the character of Sue, Hardy hints at the development of a new figure of woman who has been denied autonomy and is struggling for independence of thought and action.

### Style

The plot is based on a **symmetrical pattern** of marriage, desertion, divorce and final remarriage. The novel represents a departure from Victorianism with its portrayal of weakened vitality and grey despair, in a bleak urban setting characterized by a **sense of anxiety** and **self-destruction**. Although Hardy uses the **third-person omniscient narrator**, he denies him the possibility to explain and interpret things by focusing on the relationship between Jude and Sue, and developing the story through the characters' **repetitive dialogues**. In this way he anticipates the modern novel by means of a **two-voiced process of analysis** of the human psyche which differs both from the stream of consciousness and the interior monologue.

### T: Little Father Time

#### First part: 1-15

**Jude's discovery of the little corpses.**

>Jude stood bending over the kettle, with his watch in his hand, timing the eggs, so that his back was turned to the little inner chamber where the children lay. A shriek from Sue suddenly caused him to start round. He saw that the door of the room, or rather closet—which had seemed to go heavily upon its hinges as she pushed it back—was open, and that Sue had sunk to the floor just within it. Hastening forward to pick her up he turned his eyes to the little bed spread on the boards; no children were there. He looked in bewilderment round the room. At the back of the door were fixed two hooks for hanging garments, and from these the forms of the two youngest children were suspended, by a piece of box-cord round each of their necks, while from a nail a few yards off the body of little Jude was hanging in a similar manner. An overturned chair was near the elder boy, and his glazed eyes were slanted into the room; but those of the girl and the baby boy were closed.
>
>Half-paralyzed by the strange and consummate horror of the scene, he let Sue lie, cut the cords with his pocket-knife and threw the three children on the bed; but the feel of their bodies in the momentary handling seemed to say that they were dead. He caught up Sue, who was in fainting fits, and put her on the bed in the other room, after which he breathlessly summoned the landlady and ran out for a doctor.

Hardy uses a ==cinematic tecnique==. Jude is virtually converted into a camera focusing on the main object followed by details. This is highlighted in yellow

There is ==Jude's== immediate ==reaction== to the scene (highlighted in purple). There is a very fast rhythm

#### Second part: 16-31

**Sue's despair**

>When he got back Sue had come to herself, and the two helpless women, bending over the children in wild efforts to restore them, and the triplet of little corpses, formed a sight which overthrew his self-command. The nearest surgeon came in, but, as Jude had inferred, his presence was superfluous. The children were past saving, for though their bodies were still barely cold it was conjectured that they had been hanging more than an hour. The probability held by the parents later on, when they were able to reason on the case, was that the elder boy, on waking, looked into the outer room for Sue, and, finding her absent, was thrown into a fit of aggravated despondency that the events and information of the evening before had induced in his morbid temperament. Moreover a piece of paper was found upon the floor, on which was written, in the boy’s hand, with the bit of lead pencil that he carried:
>
>     Done because we are too menny.
>
>At sight of this Sue’s nerves utterly gave way, an awful conviction that her discourse with the boy had been the main cause of the tragedy, throwing her into a convulsive agony which knew no abatement. They carried her away against her wish to a room on the lower floor; and there she lay, her slight figure shaken with her gasps, and her eyes staring at the ceiling, the woman of the house vainly trying to soothe her.

==Her reactions== are opposite to Jude's in the sense that she breaks down and cannot find consolation (highlighted in green).

#### Third part: 32-50

**Doctor's explanation**

>They could hear from this chamber the people moving about above, and she implored to be allowed to go back, and was only kept from doing so by the assurance that, if there were any hope, her presence might do harm, and the reminder that it was necessary to take care of herself lest she should endanger a coming life. Her inquiries were incessant, and at last Jude came down and told her there was no hope. As soon as she could speak she informed him what she had said to the boy, and how she thought herself the cause of this.
>
>“No,” said Jude. “It was in his nature to do it. The Doctor says there are such boys springing up amongst us—boys of a sort unknown in the last generation—the outcome of new views of life. They seem to see all its terrors before they are old enough to have staying power to resist them. He says it is the beginning of the coming universal wish not to live. He’s an advanced man, the Doctor: but he can give no consolation to—”
>
>Jude had kept back his own grief on account of her; but he now broke down; and this stimulated Sue to efforts of sympathy which in some degree distracted her from her poignant self-reproach. When everybody was gone, she was allowed to see the children.
>
>The boy’s face expressed the whole tale of their situation. On that little shape had converged all the inauspiciousness and shadow which had darkened the first union of Jude, and all the accidents, mistakes, fears, errors of the last. He was their nodal point, their focus, their expression in a single term. For the rashness of those parents he had groaned, for their ill assortment he had quaked, and for the misfortunes of these he had died.

It is not technical: he describes the features of the last generation; ==children have no hope==; the have been deprived of the faith in the future and in progress, and of the wish to live.

Unlike ==Dickens's children==, who suffer hardship, misery, exploitation but always maintain their wish to live, and to improve their miserable condition thanks to their qualities, Hardy's children have no hope.

==Hardy's children== have no hope, because they have been deprived of an optimistic vision of life.

The lines highlighted in light blue are the ==reasons== for Little Father choice of ==suicide==; they are related to Sue's and Jude's mistakes. Little Father has acted out of despair; he had been told the previous night that Sue was pregnant again.

#### Fourth part: 51-86

**Sue's and Jude's attempts to find an explanation**

>When the house was silent, and they could do nothing but await the coroner’s inquest, a subdued, large, low voice spread into the air of the room from behind the heavy walls at the back.
>
>“What is it?” said Sue, her spasmodic breathing suspended.
>
>“The organ of the college chapel. The organist practising I suppose. It’s the anthem from the seventy-third Psalm; ‘Truly God is loving unto Israel.’”
>
>She sobbed again. “Oh, oh my babies! They had done no harm! Why should they have been taken away, and not I!”
>
>There was another stillness—broken at last by two persons in conversation somewhere without.
>
>“They are talking about us, no doubt!” moaned Sue. “‘We are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men!’”
>
>Jude listened—“No—they are not talking of us,” he said. “They are two clergymen of different views, arguing about the eastward position. Good God—the eastward position, and all creation groaning!”
>
>Then another silence, till she was seized with another uncontrollable fit of grief. “There is something external to us which says, ‘You shan’t!’ First it said, ‘You shan’t learn!’ Then it said, ‘You shan’t labour!’ Now it says, ‘You shan’t love!’”
>
>He tried to soothe her by saying, “That’s bitter of you, darling.”
>
>“But it’s true!”
>
>Thus they waited, and she went back again to her room. The baby’s frock, shoes, and socks, which had been lying on a chair at the time of his death, she would not now have removed, though Jude would fain have got them out of her sight. But whenever he touched them she implored him to let them lie, and burst out almost savagely at the woman of the house when she also attempted to put them away.
>
>Jude dreaded her dull apathetic silences almost more than her paroxysms. “Why don’t you speak to me, Jude?” she cried out, after one of these. “Don’t turn away from me! I can’t bear the loneliness of being out of your looks!”
>
>“There, dear; here I am,” he said, putting his face close to hers.
>
>“Yes… Oh, my comrade, our perfect union—our two-in-oneness—is now stained with blood!”
>
>“Shadowed by death—that’s all.”
>
>“Ah; but it was I who incited him really, though I didn’t know I was doing it! I talked to the child as one should only talk to people of mature age. I said the world was against us, that it was better to be out of life than in it at this price; and he took it literally. And I told him I was going to have another child. It upset him. Oh how bitterly he upbraided me!”
>
>“Why did you do it, Sue?”
>
>“I can’t tell. It was that I wanted to be truthful. I couldn’t bear deceiving him as to the facts of life. And yet I wasn’t truthful, for with a false delicacy I told him too obscurely.—Why was I half-wiser than my fellow-women? And not entirely wiser! Why didn’t I tell him pleasant untruths, instead of half-realities? It was my want of self-control, so that I could neither conceal things nor reveal them!”
>
>“Your plan might have been a good one for the majority of cases; only in our peculiar case it chanced to work badly perhaps. He must have known sooner or later.”

The have two completely different ==reactions==. **Jude** thinks chance has acted against them, and he thinks they can together overcame difficulties; hope is symbolized by the baby that is going to be born: a new family and a new life. **Sue** thinks their union has been shadowed by Death; she thinks their perfect union has been stained with blood and therefore it is ruined.

These different reactions will lead them ==to part==. Sue is characterized by the sense of guilt, which is due to the strict moral code of the victorian society. **Victorian society** considers their relationship obscene, while the **Church** condemns them as sinners and doesn't recognize their sorrow. *Once more religion is unable to help*.

Sentences underlined in blue contain an ironical description of ==God's love== for his people. It is ironical because actually Hardy wants to say that God has completely forgotten Jude and Sue and their needs.

After this novel Hardy's editor asked him not to write anymore novels since they were too pessimistic. He tried his hand to write poems, but they were as pessimistic and as dramatic as his novels
