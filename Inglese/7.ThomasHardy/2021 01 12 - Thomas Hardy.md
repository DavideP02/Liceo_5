## Alec and Tess
* ==p. 100==

==Tess's father=='s horse has died, and her father has discovered that his family belongs to a branch of the D'Urbervilles family, and that he has some rich relatives. The "D" in front of the name is like "von". Tess's family is poor, and they are fallen, and they have no more privileges. He discovers that he has rich relatives. He is a very low character, he drinks a lot and is very violent, and moreover he continuously bear children, and they are a big family

When the horse die, he sends his elder daughter to ==work in the farm== of this rich relative, but unfortunately here there is an older cousin. Her father expect her to work in the farm, with a good activity, but instead she becomes a poultry maid, but from the very beginning Alec wants to seduce her, since she is extremely beautiful

The ==first occasion== takes place one night, it is September evening, and she is coming back from the farm on foot. She is an outcast in the group of workers, because the girls think she is too beautiful and they are envious. The boys all wants to seduce her, and she refuses them. So she is isolated. By chance (and chance is always present) Alec, coming with his horse, asks her if she wants a lift. She accept, since she is very tired and because the others don't want her, and also because it is also an act of submission to someone much richer. Alec and Tess ride through the forest and at certain moment she realizes that he has taken the wrong turn, but it is too late.

**From line 1-45** it is shown different stages of mind she is going through
1. absent mindedness
2. weariness
3. uneasiness
4. indignation
5. embarassment

During the ride ==Alec takes advantage== of his position, in the sense that he makes advances to her: he keeps her close to him and he's very tender and affectionate. Tess is not in the position to reject Alec advances, and she even feels guilty for her treatment of him, because he is her master and she will discover that he has been giving her family some gifts:
* an horse for her father
* toys for the children

Alec and Tess ride the horse in close ==proximity==, and this is an anticipation of the sexual act. She has a moment of oblivion, a moment in which she is not able to act consciously, and he goes deeper into the forest, and then she get angry.
When she realizes this, she wants to go home, but he denies this. He promises her he will go up the hill in order to understand where they are.
They stop in a place and he prepares a nest for her. He goes away up the hill.

**From line 45-105** Tess experiences more states of mind:
1. distress
2. helplessness

What makes us understand that she is a _victorian girl_ is that she doesn't leave when he goes away. She would have the possibility to get up and run away; every clever girl would have understood what his purpose was, and would have gone away.
This part highlights the most important trait of Tess's character, which is ==passivity==: she is passive to the will of a man and of a master.

        She passively sat down [...]

There is an other symbol: ==Tess's muslin dress== which represents her fragile innocence.

The ==fog== is the symbol of Alec behavior: Alec is not behaving in a clear decorous way. He gets back and he is able to find her because of the colour of the dress.

**Line 104**: she was sleeping and there were tears on her face; we get to know that she had cried because she knew what was going to happen, and the tears were still on her eyelashes.

**Line 106-108**: many details of the wood are shown, which make us understand that nature is indifferent and society does not wish to know or understand.

The ==act of seduction== is not described, but **from line 108-111** we get to know that it has taken place, because Hardy talks about Tess's guardian angel, which was absent: this denies the possibility of relying on religion

**From line 112-125** the narrator addresses the reader directly, and he makes this by putting the activities of the human being into the contest of nature and of supernatural power. He talks about the birds and animals in the wood going about their business, than he considers that the past affects the present. He states that man's life is regulated by **chance**.

**Lines 123-124** - _An immeasurable social chasm_: makes reference that Tess and Alec came from two different social classes, and that their relationship is not acceptable to either classes, moreover it is the woman who pays the price of the lost of reputation: she is a fallen woman. From this moment on she will no longer be simple and joyful, but will have a darker side to her personality.

==Tess is not responsible== and Hardy always presents her as a victim
