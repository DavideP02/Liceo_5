# 6 mag 2021 - Virginia Woolf
## *A room of one’s own*
According to Virginia Woolf, women’s creativity has been inhibited by centuries of prejudices. To illustrate this point, she makes an example: she invents a story about Judith Shakespeare, a talented fictional sister of Shakespeare. Judith was as talented as her brother: she had the potential to became a famous writer, just like William, but she was denied the opportunities that William was offered. 

William went to school, he could study, whereas she wasn’t allowed to go to School. Virgil a Woolf recounts an episode in which Judith was even punished by her parents because they have found her with a book in her hands.
She was told that books were none of her business.

She wanted to became a writer, but her parents wanted her to marry a man that she didn’t actually love. She had been betrothed by her parents, and she was finally forced to commit suicide.

By illustrating this fictional story about Judith Shakespeare, Virginia Woolf was able to demonstrate the inequalities between women and men. Judith finally committed suicide because of the way society was structured against women.

Women need money and a **room of one’s own** to express themselves creativity. There is a mantra that is repeated in the essay: to be a writer a woman needs 40000 P a year, and then a room of one’s own, that is a space where women can be Women. They are no longer mothers or daughters, but only Women.

The image of the room actually implies an oxymoric connotation: on a first level, this room refers to a space where women can retreat and enjoy some privacy, away from her domestic duties; the real meaning of this metaphoric image refers to the possibility for women to invade spaces that historically were considered the spheres of men: it is not a place where to be confined, but it is an image for women to break confines and boundaries.
Women have to trespass trashows, to break the boundaries, so that women and men are finally really equal.
