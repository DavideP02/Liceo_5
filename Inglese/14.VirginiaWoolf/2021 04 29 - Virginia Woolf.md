Her literary technique was based on the so called **moments of being**: they are the equivalent of Joyce’s epiphany, they are moments of intensity, perception or vision which illuminate our lives

Her task as a writer is taking an ordinary mind on an ordinary day and examine the myriad of impression that the mind receives form the outer world.

## Mrs Dalloway
The actions of Mrs Dalloway is limited to the events of a single day in central London. The protagonist is Clarissa Dalloway: a middle aged woman, the wife of a politician, and she belongs to the upper-class.

The novel opens on a June morning, as Calarissa leaver her home to buy some flowers for the party she had organised in the evening.
During the day Clarissa is captured in different moods, her thoughts are described, and we also see her through the eyes and thoughts of other characters.

The other main character is Septimus Smith, whose day is contrasted by Clarissa’s day. The novel is based on the contrast between the description of these two days.
He is shell shocked, he is traumatised by the experience of the war, and he is a broken man.
He has been treated for his nervous disorders, first by doctor Holmes, who understood nothing about his pain, and then he has been treated by an other insensitive nerve specialist, Sir William Bradshaw, that wanted to hospitalise him.

At the end of the day Septimus commit suicide, by jumping out of the window of his room.

Clarissa and Septimus belongs to two different narrative lines, but they become linked to each other as Virginia Woolf constantly shift from Clarissa thoughts
Only at the very end of the novel the two different narrative lines intermingled, when we have the **climax the story**, represented by the party scene.
One of the guests of the party is Sir William Bradshaw, and he brought the news of Septimus suicide. Clarissa is quite irritated by this news, because the party was supposed to be a happy moment, but now death is present in the middle of the party.
She goes into a small room and she starts thinking about Septimus’ life, and how intolerable his life was: she experiences a **moment of being**. As he embraces death, she embraces life, she understands the importance of life.
She was almost happy that he committed suicide, since she understood the importance of life. His choosing to die is inseparable for her acceptance of life.

Even if their lives were completely different, they were absolutely linked. Septimus’ death is like the halo that illuminates Clarissa’s life, but these two characters are very different: she shows to be always aware of the contrast between her thoughts and exterior reality, on the contrary Septimus is unable to distinguish between these two different reality, and he is unable to give order to his past experiences and to his thoughts.

One of the most interesting aspect in reading Woolf’s novel is how she treats time. The **treatment of time** is a fundamental concept that characterised her style.

This extract is from the beginning of the novel: as she walks around London, her physical trajectory towards the flower shop is constantly interrupted by the interior tunnels that open up in her mind. Woolf is brilliantly able to portray the interior time and the contrast between the interior time (subjective) and the exterior time (objective)

The chimes of Big Ben represents chronological time, which contrasts her interior time. MANCA

MANCA PARTE INIZIALE SU SEPTIMUS SMITH
As he hears the explosion of this tyre, he experiences a series of feelings, such as **alienation**, and since the rumor reminded him of the war, he totally **panics**: he was paralysed in the middle of the street.
He also feels **guilty** because he thinks that he is the one responsible for the traffic congestion.
As his wife tries to bring him back to reality, he became very **angry** to her, and then he feels **madness**, since he says that he will kill himself.

The **narrative technique** is characterised by **association**; the narrative is organised piece by piece through association; the point of view constantly shifts from one character to an other.
We are catapulted into the characters’ mind; in Virginia Woolf novel we still find the figure of a narrator that gives order to the characters thoughts (different from Joyce’s style).

The extract is rich in dashes, semicolons, questions marks, exclamations, very short sentences, that are meant to reproduce the working of the mind.

### T: *Clarissa’s party*

This is taken from the very end of the novel: all the guests have finally arrived to the party, but the festive atmosphere is ruined by the news of Septimus’ suicide.

Semptimus’ death is described through a series of expressions ( TODO ==aggiungere expressions da slide 14==) that emphasise the **brutality of the act**.
