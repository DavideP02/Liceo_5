Together with Joyce, Virginia Woolf is considered one of the greatest and innovative novelist of her time. 

She continued Joyce’s experimentation with the stream of Consciousness, but their achievements were quite distinct: Joyce was more concerned with language, while Woolf was more interested in the contrast between outer reality and inner reality.

She was born in London, in 1882, and she didn’t go to school, being educated at home, because her father was an influential literary critic, and he educated Virginia.
She had the opportunity to read a lot in her father’s library, she had the opportunity to meet many men of letters during her life. 

She grew up in a cultural atmosphere of great refinement.

When she was 13 her mother died, and she had a strong breakdown. From that moment the cloud of mental instability shadowed her life. She had hallucinations, she heard phantom voices.

In addition she also suffered form severe migraine attacks.

When her father died, she moved to Bloomsbury, which is a district in London, where she founded a circle of intellectuals, that became known as *The Bloomsbury book*. The group included intellectuals in general, and Virginia Woolf married one of its members, Leonard Woolf, in 1912.

All the members of the book were anti-Victorian and unconventional, both in their view of art and in their way of living.

With her husband she founded The Hogarth Press, a publishing house that published most of her novels.

In 1915 she published her first novel, which is *The Voyage Out*, and then she tried to kill herself. This novel was still traditional, but then this novel was followed by a series of modernist masterpieces

- *Mrs Dalloway* (1925)
- *To the Lighthouse* (1927): is probably Woolf’s most celebrated novel; its most interesting aspect is its treatment of time: the novel is cantered on a single event, a planned excursion to the lighthouse, which happens to be postponed
- *Orlando* (1928): this novel recounts the adventures of Orlando, who is a man who lives over three hundred years; one morning he wakes up and he find out to be a woman; in this novel Virginia Woolf explores the themes of androgyny: the idea she develops is that human personality is too complex to be classified as male or female, and it’s always a combination of female and male aspects
- *The Waves* (1931): its her last novel, and here she draws a link between her creative and artistic process and her mental illness

She was also a great literary critic, and her most important essays are collected in *The Common Reader* (1925)

She is important because she was a supporter of the feminist cause: she wrote two important essays: *A Room of One’s Own* (1929) and *Three Guinaes* (1938), all based on the idea of feminism.

She became more and more subjected to periods of depression, and in 1941 she drowned herself in the River Ouse, near her house. Before committing suicide she wrote a touching letter in which she said she could go on living in that way.
> Death is the only experience I shall never transcribe  

## Features of her novels

1. **Inconsistent plots**: she rejected traditional eventful plot, because she was not interested in external elements, but she was concerned with her characters’ inner life
2. **The shift of the viewpoint inside the characters’ minds**: she was interested in reproducing her characters’ flow of thoughts, memories and reflections
3. **The abandonment of the chronological order of events**, because our mind jumps from past to present and future continously
4. **Highly evocative and figurative language**

Her literary technique was based on the so called **moments of being**: they are the equivalent of Joyce’s epiphany, they are moments of intensity, perception or vision which illuminate our lives

Her task as a writer is taking an ordinary mind on an ordinary day and examine the myriad of impression that the mind receives form the outer world.
> Examine for a moment an ordinary mind on an ordinary day. The mind receives a myriad of impressions. From all sides they come, an incessant shower of innumerable atoms

## *Mrs Dalloway*

The actions of Mrs Dalloway is limited to the events of a single day in central London. The protagonist is Clarissa Dalloway: a middle aged woman, the wife of a politician, and she belongs to the upper-class.

The novel opens on a June morning, as Calarissa leaver her home to buy some flowers for the party she had organised in the evening.
During the day Clarissa is captured in different moods, her thoughts are described, and we also see her through the eyes and thoughts of other characters.

The other main character is Septimus Smith, whose day is contrasted by Clarissa’s day. The novel is based on the contrast between the description of these two days.
He is shell shocked, he is traumatised by the experience of the war, and he is a broken man.
He has been treated for his nervous disorders, first by doctor Holmes, who understood nothing about his pain, and then he has been treated by an other insensitive nerve specialist, Sir William Bradshaw, that wanted to hospitalise him.

At the end of the day Septimus commit suicide, by jumping out of the window of his room.

Clarissa and Septimus belongs to two different narrative lines, but they become linked to each other as Virginia Woolf constantly shift from Clarissa thoughts
Only at the very end of the novel the two different narrative lines intermingled, when we have the **climax the story**, represented by the party scene.
One of the guests of the party is Sir William Bradshaw, and he brought the news of Septimus suicide. Clarissa is quite irritated by this news, because the party was supposed to be a happy moment, but now death is present in the middle of the party.
She goes into a small room and she starts thinking about Septimus’ life, and how intolerable his life was: she experiences a **moment of being**. As he embraces death, she embraces life, she understands the importance of life.
She was almost happy that he committed suicide, since she understood the importance of life. His choosing to die is inseparable for her acceptance of life.

Even if their lives were completely different, they were absolutely linked. Septimus’ death is like the halo that illuminates Clarissa’s life, but these two characters are very different: she shows to be always aware of the contrast between her thoughts and exterior reality, on the contrary Septimus is unable to distinguish between these two different reality, and he is unable to give order to his past experiences and to his thoughts.

### T: *Clarissa and Septimus*

![Schermata 2021-05-30 alle 18.03.21](/assets/Schermata%202021-05-30%20alle%2018.03.21.png)![Schermata 2021-05-30 alle 18.03.29](/assets/Schermata%202021-05-30%20alle%2018.03.29_17bg9tikv.png)

Clarissa Dalloway decides to buy flowers herself for the party she is going to give in the evening. She goes into Mulberry's florist shop and is greeted by Miss Pym. Clarissa enjoys the various perfumes and colours of the many flowers. She suddenly hears a noise similar to a pistol shot in the street. Miss Pym looks apologetic, as if the loud motor cars were her fault.
Clarissa and seeral other people turn to observe the mysterious person passing in a luxury car. They wonder whether it is the Queen or the Prime Minister behind the blinds.
Septimus Warren Smith, a veteran of WWI, also hears the car backfire. He suffers from shell shock, a mental illness caused by the horrors of war, and believes he is responsible for the traffic congestion the passin car causes. His young Italian wife, Lucrezia, is embarassed by his odd manner and also frightened, since Septimus has recently threatened to kill himself.

This extract is divided into five part:

- **line 1-23**: Mrs Dalloway’s visit at the florist’s is interrupted by the explosion of a tyre in the street
- **line 24-37**: various people’s reactions to the explosion and their speculations about who might be in the car
- **line 38-41**: Introduction of Septimus Warren Smith
- **line 42-53**: The busy traffic in the street and Septimus’s thoughts
- **line 54-73**: Description of Lucrezia’s appearance and thoughts. She is worried because Septimus wants to kill himself.

One of the most interesting aspect in reading Woolf’s novel is how she treats time. The **treatment of time** is a fundamental concept that characterised her style.

This extract is from the beginning of the novel: as she walks around London, her physical trajectory towards the flower shop is constantly interrupted by the interior tunnels that open up in her mind. Woolf is brilliantly able to portray the interior time and the contrast between the interior time (subjective) and the exterior time (objective)
As Clarissa walks around London, her physical trajectory towards the flower shop is constantly interrupted by the interior tunnels that open up in her mind. She is thrown into the depths of the past and the uncertain terrain of the future. The dilated quality of her interior time is interrupted by the chimes of Big Ben. The chimes of Big Ben represents chronological time, which contrasts her interior time.

We are informed by Septimus’ illness as he hears the explosion of the tyre, as he hears the explosion of this tyre, he experiences a series of feelings, such as **alienation**, and since the rumor reminded him of the war, he totally **panics**: he was paralysed in the middle of the street.
He also feels **guilty** because he thinks that he is the one responsible for the traffic congestion.
As his wife tries to bring him back to reality, he became very **angry** to her, and then he feels **madness**, since he says that he will kill himself.

The **narrative technique** is characterised by **association**; the narrative is organised piece by piece through association; the point of view constantly shifts from one character to an other.
We are catapulted into the characters’ mind; in Virginia Woolf novel we still find the figure of a narrator that gives order to the characters thoughts (different from Joyce’s style).

The extract is rich in dashes, semicolons, questions marks, exclamations, very short sentences, that are meant to reproduce the working of the mind.

### T: *Clarissa’s party*

![Schermata 2021-05-30 alle 18.05.05](/assets/Schermata%202021-05-30%20alle%2018.05.05.png)![Schermata 2021-05-30 alle 18.05.16](/assets/Schermata%202021-05-30%20alle%2018.05.16.png)

This is taken from the very end of the novel: all the guests have finally arrived to the party, but the festive atmosphere is ruined by the news of Septimus’ suicide.

Semptimus’ death is described through a series of expressions that emphasise the **brutality of the act**.

- **line 5**: His body was wounded by ‘the rusty spikes’ and smashed onto the ground
- **line 5**: *Up had flashed the ground*: inversion
- **line 5**: *blundering, bruising*: alliteration
- **line 6**: *a thud, thud, thud*: onomatopoeia and repetition
- **line 6**: *a suffocation of blackness*: metaphor

Mrs Dalloway mentally comments on the event: she is worried about the fact that death is now present in the middle of her party which was supposed to be a happy moment. Then she identifies with the young man and wonders why he has killed himself. Later on, she looks out of the window and sees an old woman staring at her from the window in the opposite room; the old woman is alone and she is going to bed. Then Clarissa hears her guests *laughing and shouting*; the clock *striking the hour* (**lines 51-4**). Mrs Dalloway is convinced that nevertheless the people at the party would go on living.  She understands that he payed to much attention to appearance and to social life.
Finally she resolves to come back to her guests.

At the very end of the novel, the difference between these two characters became very evidente.
We can connect Clarissa to an ideal of superficiality, whilee Septimus to inability to conform. An other opposition is sanity mental and illness. He is not able to overcome his pain and to find any meaning in his dramatic war experience and in fact he commit suicide.
She is the wife of a politician while Septimus rejects society: he is totally alineated for rejection of existence and final self acceptance.
She is ready to go on, after the moment of being she is a new person

## Feminism

Feminism is the belief in the social, economic, and political equality of sexes.
Historically women have been considered second class individue, and have been denied opportunity of furthering their studies, they were told that their home was the place where they belong to, and in different situation women have been subjected to men.

This movement developed in different waves:
- 1st wave of Feminism: late 19th century/early 20th century
- 2nd wave of Feminism: 1960s – 1980s
- 3rd wave of Feminism: mid 1990s
- 4th wave of Feminism: 2010s

### 1st wave of feminism

The first wave of feminism is focused on women struggle for the right to vote. Emmeline Parkhurst help women to organize themselves to get the right to vote. They started to protest in more violent ways, which challenged the ideal of domesticity.

The outbreak of WWI actually helped women in their process of emancipation . A lot of men were mobilised to go in role, and women replaced those men at work, and they proved as efficient as men. They were able to take new roles.
Also on the front line they proved fundamental as nurses.

Thanks to their role in the WWI they were able to break down all the remaining opposition to their cause.

In UK

- 1918: women over 30 gained the right to vote.
- 1928: suffrage to women over 21.

In USA

- 1919: The 19th amendment was added to the American constitution in 1919 and ratified in 1920.

### 2nd wave of feminism

It emerges in the 60s and it continued into the 80s. The difference with the first wave of feminism was that whether the first wave was totally focussed on legal rights, the second wave of feminism, that coincided with the **women’s lib movement**, touched every area of experience, politics, work, family, sexuality.

It started with the protests against the Miss America pageant in Atlantic City in 1968, since they thought that it was a cattle parade. They were against with the idea that reduced women to objects of beauty dominated by a patriarchy that sought to keep them in the home.

This second wave of feminism led women to reach many goals:
- greater access to education;
- more women in positions of leadership in different fields;
- women obtained more financial independence: in the past women didn’t own anything, since everything was of the male members of the family; in the 70s many laws were issued and women were finally recognise their financial independence;
- abortion rights, access to the contraceptive pills;
- many institution were founded, devouted to the protection and the promotion of women right: this is important, since in the past there weren’t organisations; 
- discourse about the importance of women’s right started to be on the popular level.

### 3rd wave of feminism

It emerges in the mid 1990s, because there was still some work to be done.
The peculiarity of this third way is that women rejected all the constructs that were developed in the past by the feminist of the first and the second wave.

Feminist of the third wave, refused to be identified as feminist, they rejected standardise objectivity.
They were against all those definition that had been provided in the past.

They found the word “feminist” limiting and exclusionary. They adopted a series of elements that were rejected in the past by the feminists of the first and second wave: lipstick, high heels, low cut necklines.
The idea they wanted to promote is that is possible to wear a push-up bra and a brain at the same time

In the past the use of lipstick was viewed as a form of male oppression.

### 4th wave of feminism

It emerges after 2010. The main feature is that feminists started to campaign on the web: it is strongly connected with the advent and the widespread of social media; they provided a new form of discussion, local stories can be spread worldwide.

Social media promote an idea of interconnection among women.

## Feminism and Virginia Woolf

Virginia Woolf contributed to the feminist cause since she denounced the role of subordination that women were subjected to. She was a veritable heroin to many feminists.
She was concerned to women’s position in literature.

In her diary she wrote that she was the only woman in England to say what she like: she wanted other women to freely express themselves.

She is in between the first and second wave of feminism. She took part in the campaigns of the first wave, but she is considered a forerunner of the second wave of feminism.

Her greatest contribution to feminism is represented by the essay *A room of one’s own*.
It was published in 1929, and it was based on two lectures that Virginia Woolf gave on university about women and fiction.

The style is peculiar and very innovative, since it actually seems a novel. The boundaries between criticism and fiction are extremely blurred in this essay.
This aspect is evidente since Woolf’s argument is made by a fictional character, Mary, which is the protagonist of this essay. She goes to the British museum, since she wants to know everything that has been said about women throughout history.

When she arrives at the British museum, she finds only books written by men: everything that had been said on women was said by men.
She understands that history and literature was male constructs, and she praises those few women who were able to became writers (Jane Austen, the Bronte Sisters) and than she analyses the causes for this minority of women writers.
The main reasons are related to socio-economic factors. They have been denied the opportunity to study, in the past women were often channeled in lowkey jobs, their role was to look after their children o their parents.
Because of this women’s creativity has been inhibited.

To really express themselves women need some privacy: a space where they can go and give bent to their emotions and thoughts. This space is represented by **a room of one’s own**.

### *A room of one’s own*
According to Virginia Woolf, women’s creativity has been inhibited by centuries of prejudices. To illustrate this point, she makes an example: she invents a story about Judith Shakespeare, a talented fictional sister of Shakespeare. Judith was as talented as her brother: she had the potential to became a famous writer, just like William, but she was denied the opportunities that William was offered. 

William went to school, he could study, whereas she wasn’t allowed to go to School. Virgil a Woolf recounts an episode in which Judith was even punished by her parents because they have found her with a book in her hands.
She was told that books were none of her business.

She wanted to became a writer, but her parents wanted her to marry a man that she didn’t actually love. She had been betrothed by her parents, and she was finally forced to commit suicide.

By illustrating this fictional story about Judith Shakespeare, Virginia Woolf was able to demonstrate the inequalities between women and men. Judith finally committed suicide because of the way society was structured against women.

Women need money and a **room of one’s own** to express themselves creativity. There is a mantra that is repeated in the essay: to be a writer a woman needs 40000 P a year, and then a room of one’s own, that is a space where women can be Women. They are no longer mothers or daughters, but only Women.

The image of the room actually implies an oxymoric connotation: on a first level, this room refers to a space where women can retreat and enjoy some privacy, away from her domestic duties; the real meaning of this metaphoric image refers to the possibility for women to invade spaces that historically were considered the spheres of men: it is not a place where to be confined, but it is an image for women to break confines and boundaries.
Women have to trespass trashows, to break the boundaries, so that women and men are finally really equal.

## *To the Lighthouse*

She published it in 1927, and the most important element of this novel is the treatment of time. The novel is divided into three sections:
- the window
- time passes
- the Lighthouse

**The first section** (which is the longest one) recounts the events of a single day. We find the **Ramsays**, that are a family, and they are spending their holidays in their summerhouse in the Hebrides (a group of islands near Scottland). One of the children wants to go to the Lighthouse, but because of bad wheather condition the trip has to be postponed.
It is the longest one because time is dilating because Virginia Woolf was mainly interested in the character's interior time.

The **second section** recounts with brevity the events that take place in a span of 10 years. We are informed that Ms Ramsay died, her eldest daughter also died, and one of the sons died as a victim of WWI, and this is an occasion to make a portrait of Britain in the world years, describing the athmospere of devastation boughts by the Great War.

The **third section** is based on the events of a single days. In the final section the family returns to the house in the Hebrides, Mr Ramsay finally goes to the Lighthouse with James, the child that 10 years earlier was so excited about this escursion. We find some guests that where present in the first section, such as Lily Briscoe, a painter; in the first section she started to make a portrait of Ms Ramsay and her children, and ten years later she finished the portrait.

The plot is not really relevant, the most important theme is the treatment of time, since Virginia Woolf delate and compress the time.

**Virginia Woolf symbolism**: the main symbol is the **lighthouse**, which is the alternation of light and darkness: this alternation is evident from the structure of the novel, which is A-B-A: the first section represents the long lightbeams of the lighthouse, then after this beams of light there is a pause of darkness, represented by the second section, the war years, and after this short pause we have again a flash of light, which is represented by the third section.
This alternation is also evidente in an episode that we find in the first section: Ms Ramsay has to tell her son James that they can't go to the Lighthouse. She starts thinking about the words that she can use to explain him that the trip had to be postponed. As she thinks about it she defines herself as a core of darkness, which represents her inner-self, which is different from her public self.

This novel is about the difficulty and the complexity of human relationship, because we are all thorned between our innerself and our publicself.

An other symbol is the **sea**, which is omnipresent, it is the background for every scene. The incessant movement of the waves represents the movement of Woolf's prose. Her prose was characterized by shifting different temporal places, the use of interior monologue.
