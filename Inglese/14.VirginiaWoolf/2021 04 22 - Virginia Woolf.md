Together with Joyce, Virginia Woolf is considered one of the greatest and innovative novelist of her time. 

She continued Joyce’s experimentation with the stream of Consciousness, but their achievements were quite distinct: Joyce was more concerned with language, while Woolf was more interested in the contrast between outer reality and inner reality.

She was born in London, in 1882, and she didn’t go to school, being educated at home, because her father was an influential literary critic, and he educated Virginia.
She had the opportunity to read a lot in her father’s library, she had the opportunity to meet many men of letters during her life. 

She grew up in a cultural atmosphere of great refinement.

When she was 13 her mother died, and she had a strong breakdown. From that moment the cloud of mental instability shadowed her life. She had hallucinations, she heard phantom voices.

In addition she also suffered form severe migraine attacks.

When her father died, she moved to Bloomsbury, which is a district in London, where she founded a circle of intellectuals, that became known as *The Bloomsbury book*. The group included intellectuals in general, and Virginia Woolf married one of its members, Leonard Woolf, in 1912.

All the members of the book were anti-Victorian and unconventional, both in their view of art and in their way of living.

With her husband she founded The Hogarth Press, a publishing house that published most of her novels.

In 1915 she published her first novel, which is *The Voyage Out*, and then she tried to kill herself. This novel was still traditional, but then this novel was followed by a series of modernist masterpieces
- *Mrs Dalloway* (1925)
- *To the Lighthouse* (1927): is probably Woolf’s most celebrated novel; its most interesting aspect is its treatment of time: the novel is cantered on a single event, a planned excursion to the lighthouse, which happens to be postponed
- *Orlando* (1928): this novel recounts the adventures of Orlando, who is a man who lives over three hundred years; one morning he wakes up and he find out to be a woman; in this novel Virginia Woolf explores the themes of androgyny: the idea she develops is that human personality is too complex to be classified as male or female, and it’s always a combination of female and male aspects
- *The Waves* (1931): its her last novel, and here she draws a link between her creative and artistic process and her mental illness

She was also a great literary critic, and her most important essays are collected in *The Common Reader* (1925)

She is important because she was a supporter of the feminist cause: she wrote two important essays: *A Room of One’s Own* (1929) and *Three Guinaes* (1938), all based on the idea of feminism.

She became more and more subjected to periods of depression, and in 1941 she drowned herself in the River Ouse, near her house. Before committing suicide she wrote a touching letter in which she said she could go on living in that way.

## Features of her novels

1. **Inconsistent plots**: she rejected traditional eventful plot, because she was not interested in external elements, but she was concerned with her characters’ inner life
2. **The shift of the viewpoint inside the characters’ minds**: she was interested in reproducing her characters’ flow of thoughts, memories and reflections
3. **The abandonment of the chronological order of events**, because our mind jumps from past to present and future continously
4. **Highly evocative and figurative language**
