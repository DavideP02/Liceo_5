## T: *Clarissa and Septimus*
- ==p. 268==

At the very end of the novel, the difference between these two characters became very evidente.
We can connect Clarissa to an ideal of superficiality, whilee Septimus to inability to conform. An other opposition is sanity mental and illness. He is not able to overcome his pain and to find any meaning in his dramatic war experience and in fact he commit suicide.
She is the wife of a politician while Septimus rejects society: he is totally alineated for rejection of existence and final self acceptance.
She is ready to go on, after the moment of being she is a new person

## Feminism
- ==secondo pacchetto di slide==

Feminism is the belief in the social, economic, and political equality of sexes.
Historically women have been considered second class individue, and have been denied opportunity of furthering their studies, they were told that their home was the place where they belong to, and in different situation women have been subjected to men.

This movement developed in different waves:
- 1st wave of Feminism: late 19th century/early 20th century
- 2nd wave of Feminism: 1960s – 1980s
- 3rd wave of Feminism: mid 1990s
- 4th wave of Feminism: 2010s

### 1st wave of feminism

The first wave of feminism is focused on women struggle for the right to vote. Emmeline Parkhurst help women to organize themselves to get the right to vote. They started to protest in more violent ways, which challenged the ideal of domesticity.

The outbreak of WWI actually helped women in their process of emancipation . A lot of men were mobilised to go in role, and women replaced those men at work, and they proved as efficient as men. They were able to take new roles.
Also on the front line they proved fundamental as nurses.

Thanks to their role in the WWI they were able to break down all the remaining opposition to their cause.

In UK

- 1918: women over 30 gained the right to vote.
- 1928: suffrage to women over 21.

In USA

- 1919: The 19th amendment was added to the American constitution in 1919 and ratified in 1920.

### 2nd wave of feminism

It emerges in the 60s and it continued into the 80s. The difference with the first wave of feminism was that whether the first wave was totally focussed on legal rights, the second wave of feminism, that coincided with the **women’s lib movement**, touched every area of experience, politics, work, family, sexuality.

It started with the protests against the Miss America pageant in Atlantic City in 1968, since they thought that it was a cattle parade. They were against with the idea that reduced women to objects of beauty dominated by a patriarchy that sought to keep them in the home.

This second wave of feminism led women to reach many goals:
- greater access to education;
- more women in positions of leadership in different fields;
- women obtained more financial independence: in the past women didn’t own anything, since everything was of the male members of the family; in the 70s many laws were issued and women were finally recognise their financial independence;
- abortion rights, access to the contraceptive pills;
- many institution were founded, devouted to the protection and the promotion of women right: this is important, since in the past there weren’t organisations; 
- discourse about the importance of women’s right started to be on the popular level.

### 3rd wave of feminism

It emerges in the mid 1990s, because there was still some work to be done.
The peculiarity of this third way is that women rejected all the constructs that were developed in the past by the feminist of the first and the second wave.

Feminist of the third wave, refused to be identified as feminist, they rejected standardise objectivity.
They were against all those definition that had been provided in the past.

They found the word “feminist” limiting and exclusionary. They adopted a series of elements that were rejected in the past by the feminists of the first and second wave: lipstick, high heels, low cut necklines.
The idea they wanted to promote is that is possible to wear a push-up bra and a brain at the same time

In the past the use of lipstick was viewed as a form of male oppression.

### 4th wave of feminism

It emerges after 2010. The main feature is that feminists started to campaign on the web: it is strongly connected with the advent and the widespread of social media; they provided a new form of discussion, local stories can be spread worldwide.

Social media promote an idea of interconnection among women.

## Feminism and Virginia Woolf

Virginia Woolf contributed to the feminist cause since she denounced the role of subordination that women were subjected to. She was a veritable heroin to many feminists.
She was concerned to women’s position in literature.

In her diary she wrote that she was the only woman in England to say what she like: she wanted other women to freely express themselves.

She is in between the first and second wave of feminism. She took part in the campaigns of the first wave, but she is considered a forerunner of the second wave of feminism.

Her greatest contribution to feminism is represented by the essay *A room of one’s own*.
It was published in 1929, and it was based on two lectures that Virginia Woolf gave on university about women and fiction.

The style is peculiar and very innovative, since it actually seems a novel. The boundaries between criticism and fiction are extremely blurred in this essay.
This aspect is evidente since Woolf’s argument is made by a fictional character, Mary, which is the protagonist of this essay. She goes to the British museum, since she wants to know everything that has been said about women throughout history.

When she arrives at the British museum, she finds only books written by men: everything that had been said on women was said by men.
She understands that history and literature was male constructs, and she praises those few women who were able to became writers (Jane Austen, the Bronte Sisters) and than she analyses the causes for this minority of women writers.
The main reasons are related to socio-economic factors. They have been denied the opportunity to study, in the past women were often channeled in lowkey jobs, their role was to look after their children o their parents.
Because of this women’s creativity has been inhibited.

To really express themselves women need some privacy: a space where they can go and give bent to their emotions and thoughts. This space is represented by **a room of one’s own**.
