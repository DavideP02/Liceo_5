## The birth of the Aesthetic Movement {ignore=true}

The Aesthetic Movement developed in the universities and intellectual circles in the last decades of the 19th century. It began in France with Théophile Gautier (1811-72) and reflected the sense of frustration and uncertainty of the artist, his reaction against the materialism and the restrictive moral code of the bourgeoisie, and his need to redefine the role of art. As a result, French artists withdrew from the political and social scene and escaped into aesthetic isolation, into what Gautier defined 'Art for art's sake'. The bohémien embodies his protest against the monotony and vulgarity of bourgeois life, leading an unconventional existence, pursuing sensation and excess, and cultivating art and beauty.

Aestheticism was a late 19th century European movement, which centered on the doctrine that art exist for the sake of its own beauty. Aestethicism was based on the doctrine according to which art is not supposed to have any sort of social, moral, political, didactic purpose.

It rejected the Victorian idea for which art and literature could have an important ethical role.
Many Victorians believed that they could provide a correct model of behavior which people could identify with.

Literature according to many Victorian could provide example of good action that were rewarded and for this reason literature was seen as a mean of self improvement.

The supporters of the aesthetic movement totally disagreed, arguing that art has nothing to do with morality, So, the aesthetic movement was against those Victorian utilitarian and also materialistic philosophies and it embraced beauty as the chief pursue of both art and life.

Aestheticism began in France with **Gaudier**: he was the first to Adopt the Slogan _L'art pour l'art_, meaning that art has no hidden messages but beauty.

This doctrine was imported into England by James McNeill Whistler (1834-1903), an American painter who worked in England.
However, the roots of the English Aesthetic Movement can be traced back to the Romantic poet John Keats, as well as to Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Rossetti was a remarkable example of an artist dedicated wholly to his art. John Ruskin too, in his search for beauty in life and art, even while insisting upon moral values, paved the way for the works of Walter Pater (1839-94), who is regarded as the main theorist of the Aesthetic Movement in England.

According to some critics however, in Britain the seed of the Aesthetic movement can be traced back to the romantic poet **John Keats**, and the pre-Raphaelite **Dante Gabriel Rossetti**.
- **John Keats** was a romantic poet of the second generation. He was interested in the sensual qualities of poetry and in its capacity to create an autonomous world. In this, sense conceiving art as a separate reality, his verse somehow anticipated the art fo art's sake tendency of the 19th century.
- **Dante Gabriel Rossetti** was a poet and a painter. He belongs to the pre-Raphaelite brotherhood, actually he found it in 1848. The artists of this brotherhood reacted against the dull and unimaginative artistic production of the period by returning to the aesthetic value of the italian painters of the 13th anr the 14th century, who lived before Raffaello.

There are two main important figures who belong to the English Aesthetic movement:
- **John Ruskin** was a leading art critic of the 2nd half of the 19th century; he was highly influential because in his search of beauty in art and life he paved the way fo the work of Walter Peter
- **Walter Peter** is considered the main theorist of the Aesthetic movement. He found in art the only certainty and for this reason he believed that life should be lived as a work of art. He insisted on the concept of **artistic autonomy**; he felt that art should be independent from worldly issues such as politics or morality, because art should be appreciated for its own intrinsic beauty

Walter Pater's _Studies in the History of the Renaissance_ (1873) and his masterpiece _Marius the Epicurean_ (1885) were immediately successful, especially with the young, because of their subversive and potentially demoralising message. He rejected religious faith and said that art was the only means to halt the passage of time, the only certainty. He thought life should be lived in the spirit of art, namely as a work of art, filling each passing moment with intense experience, feeling all kinds of sensations. The task of the artist was to feel sensations, to be attentive to the attractive, the courteous and the cheerful. So the artist was seen as the transcriber 'not of the world, not of mere fact, but of his sense of it! The main implication of this new aesthetic position was that art had no reference to life, and therefore it had nothing to do with morality and did not need to be didactic.

Pater's works had a deep influence on the poets and writers of the 1890s, especially Oscar Wilde, as well as the group of artists that met in the Rhymers' Club and contributed to _The Yellow Book_. This periodical, published from 1894 to 1897, reflected decadent' taste in its sensational subjects. The term decadent' generally implied a process of decline of recognised values. By the end of the century it was used as an aesthetic term across Europe.

## Main Features

A number of features can be distinguished in the works of Aesthetic artists:
* excessive attention to the self;
* hedonistic and sensuous attitude;
* perversity in subject matter;
* disenchantment with contemporary society;
* evocative use of language.

Stylistically the works of the aesthetic writers were highly refined, and they appealed to the senses; they showed an intense connotation of sensuality and hedonism, which is the philosophy according to which pleasure is the main aim in human life.

Their work showed a fierce individualism, in opposition to anything mainstream.

Their work also showed a franc disenchantment with contemporary society; the supporters of the aesthetic movement in literature wanted to shock the middle classes with their art, often creating sexually suggestive pieces of work, that opposed to the Victorian sense of Morality.

Considering the subject matter, they felt free to break the boundaries; they were interested in the exploration of sexuality and of course one of the main themes is the insistence on the close relationship between art and life.

This artist commitment to their theories and belief was so strong that eventually Aestheticism pretended the boundaries of art to became a life style. This mean that component of aesthetic ideology can be seen in the way of living itself.

Supporters of the aesthetic movement lived their life in their approach to fashion, sexuality, but also in the approach to Alcohol and drugs. They were generally seen as heavy alcohol consumers and they were fascinated with the use of drugs.

Considering this close relationship whit art and life there is another key concept that is **dandyism**. A Dandy is a person who pays particular attention to his personal appearance. Usually a Dandy wear eccentric and very elegant clothes, and he is a person who aim at upholding a high level of sophistication in his lifestyle.

## Decadence

The term **Decadence** is often associated with aestheticism.

Decadence must be seen as a European movement. In the late 1880s a group of French writers contributed to the journal _Le Décadent_; they were the Symbolists Rimbaud, Verlaine, Mallarmé, Laforgue, who were much influenced by Charles Baudelaire's _Les Fleurs du mal_ (1857). Joris-Karl Huysmans (1848-1907) wrote _A rebours_ (1884), a novel whose hero, Des Esseintes, tries to create an entirely artificial life in his search for unusual sensations. This character became the model for Wilde's dandy. The main representatives of Decadence in Italy were Gabriele D'Annunzio (1863-1938), with his novel _Il piacere_ (1889), and the poets Giovanni Pascoli (1855-1912) and Guido Gozzano (1883-1916). The poetry of Rainer Maria Rilke (1875-1926) was one of the most remarkable expressions of the Decadent sensibility in the German language.

This word was initially to descrive some French writers of the mid 19th century; in particular decadence is associated to the poetry of
- Verlaine
- MallarmÃ©
- Rimbaud
- Baudelaire
- Huysmans

The term decadence is also associated to the novel "Ã€ Rebours" by Huysmans. The protagonist is Des Esseintes, and he is a decadent aristocrat; he has an obsession with sensual experiments and the novel is based on his taste for luxury and excess.

Aestheticism and decadence share a set of interlinked qualities such as
- the notion of intense refinement
- the perversity in subject matter
- the use of paradoxes
- the progressive attitude towards sexuality.

Decadence was an European movement which did not only developed in France.
In Italy, for instance, the main representatives of the Decadent movement were D'Annunzio (with his novel _Il Piacere_), Pascoli and Gozzano
