# Aestheticism

* ==p. 29-30==

Aestheticism was a late 19th century European movement, which centered on the doctrine that art exist for the sake of its own beauty. Aestethicism was based on the doctrine according to which art is not supposed to have any sort of social, moral, political, didactic purpose.

It rejected the Victorian idea for which art and literature could have an important ethical role.
Many Victorians believed that they could provide a correct model of behavior which people could identify with.

Literature according to many Victorian could provide example of good action that were rewarded and for this reason literature was seen as a mean of self improvement.

The supporters of the aesthetic movement totally disagreed, arguing that art has nothing to do with morality, So, the aesthetic movement was against those Victorian utilitarian and also materialistic philosophies and it embraced beauty as the chief pursue of both art and life.

Aestheticism began in France with **Gaudier**: he was the first to Adopt the Slogan _L'art pour l'art_, meaning that art has no hidden messages but beauty.

According to some critics however, in Britain the seed of the Aesthetic movement can be traced back to the romantic poet **John Keats**, and the pre-Raphaelite **Dante Gabriel Rossetti**.
- **John Keats** was a romantic poet of the second generation. He was interested in the sensual qualities of poetry and in its capacity to create an autonomous world. In this, sense conceiving art as a separate reality, his verse somehow anticipated the art fo art's sake tendency of the 19th century.
- **Dante Gabriel Rossetti** was a poet and a painter. He belongs to the pre-Raphaelite brotherhood, actually he found it in 1848. The artists of this brotherhood reacted against the dull and unimaginative artistic production of the period by returning to the aesthetic value of the italian painters of the 13th anr the 14th century, who lived before Raffaello.

There are two main important figures who belong to the English Aesthetic movement:
- **John Ruskin** was a leading art critic of the 2nd half of the 19th century; he was highly influential because in his search of beauty in art and life he paved the way fo the work of Walter Peter
- **Walter Peter** is considered the main theorist of the Aesthetic movement. He found in art the only certainty and for this reason he believed that life should be lived as a work of art. He insisted on the concept of **artistic autonomy**; he felt that art should be independent from worldly issues such as politics or morality, because art should be appreciated for its own intrinsic beauty

## Main Features

Stylistically the works of the aesthetic writers were highly refined, and they appealed to the senses; they showed an intense connotation of sensuality and hedonism, which is the philosophy according to which pleasure is the main aim in human life.

Their work showed a fierce individualism, in opposition to anything mainstream.

Their work also showed a franc disenchantment with contemporary society; the supporters of the aesthetic movement in literature wanted to shock the middle classes with their art, often creating sexually suggestive pieces of work, that opposed to the Victorian sense of Morality.

Considering the subject matter, they felt free to break the boundaries; they were interested in the exploration of sexuality and of course one of the main themes is the insistence on the close relationship between art and life.

This artist commitment to their theories and belief was so strong that eventually Aestheticism pretended the boundaries of art to became a life style. This mean that component of aesthetic ideology can be seen in the way of living itself.

Supporters of the aesthetic movement lived their life in their approach to fashion, sexuality, but also in the approach to Alcohol and drugs. They were generally seen as heavy alcohol consumers and they were fascinated with the use of drugs.

Considering this close relationship whit art and life there is another key concept that is **dandyism**. A Dandy is a person who pays particular attention to his personal appearance. Usually a Dandy wear eccentric and very elegant clothes, and he is a person who aim at upholding a high level of sophistication in his lifestyle.

## Decadence

The term **Decadence** is often associated with aestheticism.

This word was initially to descrive some French writers of the mid 19th century; in particular decadence is associated to the poetry of
- Verlaine
- MallarmÃ©
- Rimbaud
- Baudelaire
- Huysmans

The term decadence is also associated to the novel "Ã€ Rebours" by Huysmans. The protagonist is Des Esseintes, and he is a decadent aristocrat; he has an obsession with sensual experiments and the novel is based on his taste for luxury and excess.

Aestheticism and decadence share a set of interlinked qualities such as
- the notion of intense refinement
- the perversity in subject matter
- the use of paradoxes
- the progressive attitude towards sexuality.

Decadence was an European movement which did not only developed in France.
