The term **Decadence** is often associated with aestheticism.

This word was initially to descrive some French writers of the mid 19th century; in particular decadence is associated to the poetry of
- Verlaine
- Mallarmé
- Rimbaud
- Baudelaire
- Huysmans

The term decadence is also associated to the novel "À Rebours" by Huysmans. The protagonist is Des Esseintes, and he is a decadent aristocrat; he has an obsession with sensual experiments and the novel is based on his taste for luxury and excess.

Aestheticism and decadence share a set of interlinked qualities such as
- the notion of intense refinement
- the perversity in subject matter
- the use of paradoxes
- the progressive attitude towards sexuality.

Decadence was an European movement which did not only developed in France.
In Italy, for instance, the main representatives of the Decadent movement were D'Annunzio (with his novel _Il Piacere_), Pascoli and Gozzano
