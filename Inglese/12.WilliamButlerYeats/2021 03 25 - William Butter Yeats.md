# 25 mar 2021 - William Butter Yeats

## T: _Easter 1916_
- ==p. 198==

Yeats was a symbolist, and in this poem he proves his ability as a symbolist, by recurring to some symbols that convey powerful meanings, sometimes contrasting each other:
- the **stone**: it may stand for the Anglo-Irish conflict, it may stand for the rebel's heart: this association can have both negative and positive connotations
  - the positive connotations refer to the idea of strength that a stone implies
  - the negative connotations refer to the static nature of stones: to the steady focus on the cause for independence, although it is actually a noble dream, has made the rebel's heart stone-like; their fixation ended up bringing violence and destruction;
- the **stone** might also symbolize both the admiration and the criticism for the rebels by Yeats
- the **sleeping child**: this image is used to refer to the death rebels; sleep is a common metaphor for death in poetry, and the image of child implies an idea of innocence; just like children can sometimes unintentionally produce some harm, so the rebel are not guilty, because they didn't intend to cause any harm for fighting for their independence
- the **mother**: it can be read as a symbol for Ireland itself; according to this interpretation, the rebels can be imagined as Ireland's children

## T: _The Second Coming_
- ==p. 200==

This is one of Yeats' most famous poem, belonging to the last period of his career.

It was written in 1919, and it was published after a series of bloodshed:
- two years after the Russian revolution
- the end of WWI
- the conflict between Irish patriots and English government was at its pick

Its conclusion also seems to predict the rise of Hitler and the nazi party.

Portraying a world on the edge of catastrophe, this poem is deeply pessimistic about the new phase that the world is entering.

To fully understand this poem, it is useful to look at Yeats' view of history. He is influenced by the cyclical theory of the Italian philosopher Gian Battista Vico.
Yeats always professes to see the world as in a state of perpetuale flux: in this regard, his idea of history was based on what he called **gyres**.
A gyre is a geometric figure composed of two cones, rotating in opposite directions.
According to Yeats history is made of different historical phases, which he calls gyres, usually contrasting with each other.

Each historical phase is followed by an other one which has contrasting elements, in comparison to the previous one. Each dominant historical phase always contains its antithesis.

The title of this poem evokes the second coming of Christ, predicted by Matthew in the Bible. According to it Jesus Christ is supposed to return, and save those who deserve being saved, the true believers, bringing them to heaven.

The second coming described by Yeats is not referred to Christ: he perceives that some rough beast, which he cannot name, is waiting to be born. This image of the **rough beast** clearly suggest that this second coming will not be that of Christ, but that of an Anti-Christ.

The **first stanza** describes a world characterized by anarchy and blood. The picture introduced is one of violence and change.
The lines of this stanza can be read almost as a commentary on the times. The first stanza expresses the disintegration of our civilization. To describe this disintegration Yeats uses a series of images
- **the falcon** _turning and turning in the widening gyre_ represents the cycle of history that is disintegrating
- **the falcon** who _cannot hear the falconer_ stands for lack of communication

The **second stanza** describes a nightmarish picture connected to the second coming.
It predicts the beginning of a new age, a sort of anti-christian age, characterized by violence, lack of values and lack of communication.
Line **9 and 10** are rich in repetitions.
All these repetitions create a sort of onomatopeic effect, that suggest the repetitive movement of the gyre.
