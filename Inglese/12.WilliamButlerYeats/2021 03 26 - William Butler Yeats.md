# 26 mar 2021 - William Butler Yeats

## T: The Second Coming
- ==p. 200==

The poet has a vision, an image coming from the _Spiritus Mundi_ emerges in the poet's mind. This _Spiritus Mundi_ it's the soul of the universe to which men are connected through the great memory: it's a sort of universal subconscious, were the memories of the human race are preserved: it's similar to Jung's idea of the Collective Unconscious.

The main symbol we find here is the **rought beast**. Many critics remark that this poem is deeply concerned with the drama of modern war.
Yeats himself described his poem as a reaction to the growing murderousness of the world.
This concern with war marks this poem as a modern work.

Some critics have also connected this __rough beast__ with the figure of Hitler, and it is prophetic, since it predicts the rise of Nazism. Perhaps connecting this image to a single historical figure or event is reductive, because for Yeats this rough beast is fearful image which arises out of the collapse of the existing order.
This creature arises from the fact the _Things fall apart_ and _the centre cannot hold_ (**line 3**). Yeat's vision offers a more general vision of evil.

This poem is an apocalyptic vision of the future of mankind.

The poem is meter irregular, and it doesn't have a fixed rhyme scheme. Describing a world of chaos, anarchy and confusion, it make sense that the poem doesn't follow a standard scheme or fixed rhyme pattern, which would convey an idea of order, balance and linearity
