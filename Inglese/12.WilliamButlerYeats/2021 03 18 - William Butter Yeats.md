# 18 mar 2021 - William Butter Yeats

## Themes

### Age

Yeats was almost obsessed with age.
His preoccupation with old age is based on the contrast between the failing body and the willing heart.

### Death

It's another key theme. Yeats view was that unlike the animals, that dies once and forever, man dies many times before his real death.

Every defeat, as well as every victory, represents a series of death and rebirth, prefiguring the end of life.
This continuos cycle of Death and Rebirth is promoted by an incessant and endless process of change and renewal

### Idea of the heroic individual

Loneliness is a feature of his hero; he has superior qualities, that distinguish him from the common men.

Yeats develop the image of the solitary soul.

### Polarity between opposites concepts

such as the physical and the spiritual, the real and the imagined.

### Deep fascination for occultism

Yeats was a believer in magic and similar arts, he was a visionary, he was religious by temperament but he was unable to believe in christian orthodoxy

All his life he tried to compensate his lost sense of religion, and this search led him to various kind of mysticism and spiritualism, neoplatonism, and also to **theosophy**.

In London he joined the Theosophical society, whose mysticism appealed to Yeats; this mysticism was based on a form of immaginative life.
Theosophy is the belief in a deeper spiritual reality.

According to Yeats people can came in contact with this deeper reality through
- intuition
- meditation
- revelation
- use of symbols

Yeats develop its own symbolic system, which is exposed in his book _A Vision_. This book represents the full exposition of his philosophy and his ideas. It is still a very obscure book, and in fact it led to describe Yeats as one of the most difficult among the modern poets.

Yeats distinguish between two kind of symbols: emotional and intellectual;
- **emotional symbols** evocke emotions
- **intellectual symbols** evoque ideas

Symbols are to primary importance to Yeats, since they contribute to the definition of a collective consciousness.

In this regards Yeats develop the concept of the great memory, that is a concept that is strongly connected to the Jung's concept of the Collective unconscious.
They both believe that we interact with the world through a system of archetypes, which express a set of human truth, that are passed on from generation to generation

The reader’s difficulties in reading Yeats arrive mainly from Yeats’s use of the same symbol to represent a variety of things.
One of his main theme is the falcon which represents a violent break from any form of control but it also represent grace
Another important symbol is the swan. On one hand it represents a perfect unchanging ideal while, on the other hand, it becomes a symbol of destructive
power.
The tower is another famous symbol . The tower can be an intellectual shelter but sometimes it becomes a vision of the dark future of humanity

## Style

His style is characterized by a great variety of forms, rhythms and tone.
Stylistically Yeats is at the same time a traditionalist and an innovator: he worked with traditional genres, but he disrupted conventions by breaking the coherence of this more traditional form.

Also stylistically Yeats tries to convey a tension between opposite concepts, by making a large use of antithesis, oximoron and paradoxes.

## T: _Easter 1916_

- ==p. 198==

This poem was written after the Easter Rising, an insurrection which took place in Ireland in 1916.
During the Easter week in 1916 some rebels decided to sid Dublin strategic point while the british were fighting in WWI

But the British troops were able to intervene and to repress these protests. Some were executed and many citizens were arrested. This rebellion didn’t directly lead Ireland to reach independence but it represented an important step in order to reach it.
After the execution carried out by the British the Irish became increasingly hostile towards the british Rule and so they started to further promote the cause of their independence.

In the election of 1918 the Sein Fein party won the largest proportion of the Irish seats in the British Parliament. This Party decided to form its own governement, with the help of IRA. This was led to the anglo-irish treaty, that marked the birth of the Irish free state.
