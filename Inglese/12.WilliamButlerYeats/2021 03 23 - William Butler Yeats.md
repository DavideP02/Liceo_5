# 23 mar 2021 - William Butler Yeats

## T: _Easter 1916_
- ==p. 198==

This poem expresses the poet's contrasted feelings respect the up rising which took place in Dublin in 1916.

The themes are
- heroism
- bravery
- public sacrifice
- death
- mourning

Yeats uses a chain of multiple unanswered questions to express his difficulty in finding the appropriate response to this historical event.

The **first stanza** is based on a series of contrasts:
1. between two different subject's pronoun: "_I_" (**line 1**) refers to Yeats, he was a witness [testimone] to the Easter Rising; "_them"_ (**line 1**) refers to the Irish insurgence, that Y. used to meet at the end of the day
2. between the insurgence _vivid faces_ (**line 2**) and the _grey Eighteenth-century houses_ (**line 3-4**)
3. there is a contrast between these people and the poet, because the _vivid faces_ of these people might have easily revealed some internal agitation, but when meeting them, the poet proved unable to take their passion seriously, he didn't feel close to their internal agitation: he just acknowlegde them with a nod, or he exchange some meaningless small talk, just to be polite; sometimes he even mocked them with his friends; for Y. all these people were just living their normal life, but then something happen, and everything change

In the **second stanza** the poet became more specific about the people he used to meet, he provides us with some details and personal information about some of the rebels.

The **third stanza** opens with a reference to the hearts that have only one aim, referring to the rebels and to their single-minded dedication. Y. is suggesting that those people who totally devote themselves to some unchanging goals, may finally lose their ordinary human feelings, to the point that their heart is like a stone travelling the _living stream_.
This _living stream_ (**line 44**) stands for the flowing of life while the hearts with one purpose refers to the rebels, who dedicate all their energy to one single goal.

This _stone_ (**lines 43-47**) might also be read as an allusion to the anglo-irish conflict. Y. is developing the idea that everything changes in nature, in order to adapt to the situation, whereas stones simply exist to the same state on a endless basis.

People who devote themself to unchanging goals might finally end up in being like stones, because they lose their most peculiar human feature, that is the ability to change and to adapt for their own survival.

In the **fourth stanza** the poet wonders whether the rebels sacrifice was useful and worthwhile.

Maybe it is possible that England, would have granted Ireland it's independence without this violent rebellion.
Many people were killed.

Y. affirms that it is not up to him to establish this. It's God who has to answer this question, and our duty is just to honor the rebels memory, and remember the rebels with respect.

To emphasize the respect that people should owe to the rebels, Y. uses a symbolic image.
He says that our attitude towards the death rebels should be the same attitute of a mother when taking care of her sleeping child, looks at him and says name, with the utmost love and utmost seriousness.
Y. is also making an associaton with this symbol, establishing a link between death and sleep, which reveals a conforting idea of death, and which has christian implication.

Then Y. immediately rejects this idea, because the rebels are truly dead, and this is not something temporary, so it is not the case to soften the harshness of the reality.

At **line 74** Y. states the act he is performing. He wrote this line to celebrate the rebels who sacrificed their lives to a dream.
This line bridges the poet, the heroes and the readers.

At **line 75-76** he mentions some of the insurgence, and by directly naming them, we see how, through the poem, these insurgence have gone through a radical process of transformation to the eyes of the poet.
From the idea of ordinary people, they ended up as heroes to be honoured at the end of the poem, because they nobly die for their cause, and they deserve being remembered.

The poem ends with a line which is repeated at the end of the first and the second stanza. These lines contains and oximoron (_terrible // beauty_). This line is a sort of refrain [ritornello] that clearly conveys the feelings of the poet about the sacrifice implied in the change.
Y. attitude oscillates between a feeling of ammiration for their bravery and a feeling of conflict for the cost of their commitment.
In the end he cannot say if the rebels sacrifies was worth the cost.
His attitude is ambivalent and characterised by approval and disapproval at the same time.
This line perfectly registers the contrast between the nobility of the rebels cause and the devastating price they payed for it. This line also perfectly register the poet's uncertainty about how to make sense of had happened.
