# James Joyce

He is one of the towering figures of modern literature. If Eliot was the central figure in modernist poetry, Joyce was the greatest genius in modernist prose.

He was a great experimenter, and he introduces the techniques of the stream of consciousness in the english novel.

His fundamental aim was to represents the human conditions as a universal and objective reality.
His concerns extended to mankind, and not only to his times.

Joyce was born in Dublin, but he spend most of his adult life abroad. He went on a sort of volountary exile, because he found people living in Ireland as narrow-minded, and he found the cultural atmosphere in Ireland as stagnant.
Ireland was to tied to the past, according to Joyce.

To him, Dublin was the centre of paralysis, and he chose this city for his book _Dubliners_.
It was the centre for all his fictional universe.

Critics agree that Joyce has made Dublin the capital of literary cities in the 20th century. Joyce turned Dublin into a microcosm of the whole universe. Dublin stands for the whole universe.

## _A Portrait of the Artist as a young man_

In his literary production Joyce brought this city to life again and again. Dublin isn't the setting only of _Dubliners_, but also of _A Portrait of the Artist as a young man_, which is his first novel, published in 1916. By the time Joyce came to write this novel, he had been away from Dublin for 10 years.

This prolonged temporal and geographical distance influence his method of evoking Dublin: in _Dubliners_ the city emerges as a concrete urban landscape, instead in _A Portrait of the Artist as a young man_ Dublin is filtered through the protagonist's consciousness; Dublin is no longer out there in the world, but it is inside the protagonist's imagination.

Here the **style** is less realistic that in Dubliners.

This novel deals with the spiritual development of a young man, and for this reason we can read this as a novel of education (or a Bildungsroman) [romanzo di formazione].

The protagonist is a Young irish writer, who is in search of experience and success.

The protagonist is internally divided between the standards of an ascetic religious upbringing and his desire for sensuousness.

This can be read as a novel of education, but this novel also appears to be very **autobiographical**.

In its depiction of the protagonist's childhood, adolescence, and gradual growth into a modern artist, this novel appears to be heavily autobiographical.
_A Portrait of the Artists as a young man_ is actually a Joyce's portrait. The protagonist is Joyce's fictional projection of himself.

The hero, Stephen Dedalus has many ==traits in common with the author==:
- he is the son of a poor father, as Joyce
- Stephen's mother is a fervent catholic woman, like Joyce's own mother
- Like Joyce, Stephen attend jesuit school
- Like Joyce, Stephen goes on a voluntary exile in Paris
The novel is mostly played in Dublin, but at the end the setting in place changes to Paris.
- Stephen rejected his people, his nation and his religion, to find fulfillment as a **martyr artist**, as Joyce
The protagonist name can be read as a symbol of a martyr artist:
  - Stephen remind us of **Saint Stephen**, the first martyr of christianity, who was accused of blasphemy, and he was stoned to death, because he was preaching a new religion; Stephen thinks of himself as a victim of incomprehention in his own land;
  - **Dedalus** is a mithological character, he was an artist and a skillful craftsman: he built the labyrinth for King Minos, and then he was imprisoned by the king within the labyrinth; Dedalus was able to escape from the labyrinth by creating two wax wings; Stephen Dedalus decided to leave Ireland on the winds of their own art.

Joyce preserved a cool detachment from his character.

Stephen lives in an ordinary, trivial and banal environment, which is too much in contrast with its inner aspirations.

At the end of the novel, Stephen experiences what the author call an **epiphany**: it's a moment of revelation, which enabled him to discover his true task in becoming an artist.
Becoming an artist is the only way to go beyond the mediocrity surrounding him, and it's the only way to achieve the deepest meaning of life.

The development of Stephen's consciousness is interesting since although it's described with a great objectivity it gives us an insight of the influences and the tensions that shaped Joyce's own mind.

In this novel through the character of Stephen, Joyce is able to insert a **programmatic manifesto** on what he sees as the **role of the modernist writer**.
In this novel Stephen work out a theory, according to which the artist is like the God of creation, that _remains within or behind or beyond or above his work_, invisible, refined out of existence and indifferent.

This is a view of art that implies **objectivity** and impersonality, even the exile of the artist, even though the artist actually uses material provided by his own life. The artist should not express his view point.
This idea of impersonality was present also in Eliot.

### Style

The novel begins with a third person narrator, and then it switches to a first person narrator. This first person narrator obviously further catapults us into ==Stephen's mind==.

The most famous aspect's of this novel is Joyce's innovative use of the **stream of consciousness**.
Through this technique the writer almost disappears, and the readers find themselves directly inside a character's mind.

Rather then describing character's sensations, feelings and thoughts from an external point of view, the stream of consciousness allows the author to directly transcribe the thoughts and the sensations that go through the character's mind.

Joyce develops the **language** from what it's appropriate to the small child of the first pages, to the articulate comments on art made by a university student, which is Stephen at the end of the novel.
The language changes through the novel, according to the protagonist growth.

It's peculiar the presence of **peaks of intensity** in the narration, that Joyce calls ==epiphanies==.
He explains what an epiphany is in a first draft of this novel: it's a sudden revelation in which the soul of the commonest object seems to us radiant.
It is a sudden spiritual awakening, when ordinary thoughts and feelings come together to produce a new awareness.

An epiphany is usually associated to an external element, which can be an object, a sound, a music, a sight of something, that triggers a new awareness.

### Structure

The novel is made up of five chapters, that follow chronologically Stephen life from childhood through adolescence until the age of 20.

The novel is mainly settled in Dublin, which is largely populated bu characters who closely resemble Joyce's family members, friends and enemies.

During the novel the protagonist go through a series of crucial transformations:

1. in the ==first part of the novel==, Stephen is a shy little boy, but at school he proves to be a **brilliant student**;
2. Stephen is leaved with a **prostitute**, and this is the protagonist's transition from innocence to corruption;
3. Stephen, from a sinner, decide to become a **fervent catholic**;
4. in the ==fourth chapter== there is the most important, when Stephen rejects his religiousness, to a new devotion to **art and beauty**; this transformation is reinforced in the last chapter, when he is finally an artist.

### T: *Where was his boyhood now?*

![Schermata 2021-05-30 alle 17.26.44](/assets/Schermata%202021-05-30%20alle%2017.26.44.png)![Schermata 2021-05-30 alle 17.27.21](/assets/Schermata%202021-05-30%20alle%2017.27.21_3v5pj2839.png)

The setting is a shore: Stephen is looking at the sea in front of him, he is looking at the sky and at the water, and he’s admiring this beautiful wild scenery.

There is very little action in the usual sense of the term, because here Joyce is more interested in Stephen’s emotions.

At the beginning Stephen is alone, and then he ears some childish voices: when he ear some children playing on the beach, he suddenly realises that his boyhood is over.

Then he notices a girl, and there is this beautiful description of the girl (**from line 25 to 30**), which gives an idea of elegance, purity, freedom, softness, purity, chastity.
This girl embodies these concepts.

When Stephen looks at the girl, he experiences an **epiphany**; he feels very excited and in this moment he expresses his wish to break free from all the constriction imposed by the Catholic Church and by the town of Dublin.

There are some negative expression related to his boyhood:

- **line 1**: *the grave of boyhood* linked to *grave clothes*
- **line 18**: _house of squalor_

These images convey the squalor of Stephen’s life.

#### Style

There is a third person narrator, while the POV is Stephen’s.

The language is Stephen’s language, and in order to reproduce Stephen’s thoughts Joyce uses different expression, and **free direct speech**:

- **line 1**: *Yes! Yes! Yes!*
- **line 6**: *On! On!*
- **lines 17-19**: *Where was... was he?*
- **line 43-44**: *To live... out of life*: this sentence reflects Stephen’s artistic creed
- **line 46**: *On and... and on!*

## *Dubliners*

He published it in 1914, but he finish writing this stories in 1907: he took him 7 years to get his book published.
It's a collection of fifteen stories, which are arranged in thematic sequence: we can distinguish four section, each one represents one stage in life: **childhood** (the *Sister*), **adolescence** (*Eveling*), **maturity** (*Clay*) and **public life** (*the Dead*)

### *The Dead*

![Schermata 2021-05-30 alle 17.28.58](/assets/Schermata%202021-05-30%20alle%2017.28.58_6jfrf8yhw.png)
![Schermata 2021-05-30 alle 17.29.18](/assets/Schermata%202021-05-30%20alle%2017.29.18.png)

It is the last story and the longer one, and probably the most important story.
The setting is always Dublin, since he saw it as the center of **paralysis**. Dublin is considered by Joyce the center of paralysis. All his fifteen stories reflect this feeling of stagnation and decay that Joyce associated with Ireland and with the city of Dublin.
The Dead can be read as the climax of this cultural and social stagnation.

This is the longest story, the most complex one, but it is also the most important because it it here that we find one of Joyces first examples of **indirect interior monologue**, a technique that he would master in his later production.

The style is still traditional in the whole book, and it is realistic: he portrays Dublin in a realistic way, and this book is still traditional, but the narration is often interspersed with moments of intensity: **ephipany**

It is an acute analysis of Dublin's life. There are fifteen stories in this collection, the settin is Dublin because it is the center of paralysis.

All the protagonists of this story experience this sense of paralyses, because they are all tied to their antiquated social and cultural tradition. They are also inhibited by repressive moral codes 

The Dead is the last story, and it is the climax of this feeling of stagnation that rounds trhough all the stories, that pervades all the stories.

Stilistically speaking Dubliners is still traditional, and it is characterized by a strong descriptive realism. It also includes some more innovative elements that will characterize his later production.
These innovative elements are
- absence of a moralizing narrator
- no presence of a onniscent narrator
- the stories are told trough the character's perspective, we follow their thoughts
- the story is often interspersed with moments of insights that Joyce calls ephipanies

In the final story, _the Dead_, Joyce goes beyond the earlier stories, because he produces a more compassionate view of the characters, there is a more intimate study of the characters and he moves away from the descriptive realism and from the objective presentation that characterize the rest of the book. This descriptive realism was the dominant approach in the rest of the book. In this last story, he partly abandons it, and he move towars a more intimate study of his characters.

In _the Dead_ we also find one of his first fully realized example of the interior monologue: it is used to reproduce the stream of consciousness that takes place in a persons mind.

_The Dead_ can be divided into two different sections:
- in the first section the protagonist, Gabriel Conroy, is at a dinner party
- in the second section we find a sort of musical coda, which contains the protagonist's reflections and meditation on what happened at the pary.

#### First section

The protagonist has two aunts, Julia and Kate Mokran, they are two elderly unmarried women, and they have the tradition of organizing a party every year during the christmas holidays, in which they invite all their family members and their friends, and so this is the occasion.

This party is held shortly after christmas, and this gathering is an occasion for Joyce to make a portrait of Dublin: there are people of different generation, there are people with different religion believes, and there are also different political simpaties. He makes a portrait of Dublin as the heart of modern Ireland, but more generally speaking Dublin becomes the heart of modern society.
He presents a microcosm that stands for modern society.

The high point of this party is a speech that Gabriel makes in front of everybody, and he is applauded by everyone, and so he feels exaltant, he is filled with self-love and self-satisfaction, he feels important.
The reals central event of the party is Gretta's Ephipany; she is Gabriel's wife, and she is also present at the party: during the party she hears an old irish song, and when she ears it she is on the stairs, and so she's paralysed on these stairs, as if time stopped for her, because that song reminded her of Michael Furey, her first love, and probably her only true love; she steps out of time and she goes back to her youth.

During Gretta's auditory ephipany there is also Gabriel's visual ephipany, that happen at the same time.
She stops on the stairs, and Gabriel looks at his life from the bottom of the stairs: she is like the figure of a painting, and this is probably the first time that he took some time to look at his wife in her whole appearance.

After the party they go to a near by Hotel, and during this walk Gabriel feels phisical desire for his wife, he remembers their courtship and their premarried life and all the happy moments of their married life. He is fillled with physical desire for his wife.

As soon as they reach the intimacy of the hotel bedroom, to his great astonishment, he discovers that his wife is crying, because she is thinking about Michael Feury. 
She explains him that during the party she had heard an old irish song, that had took her to her youth, and she tells him about Michael Furey, a boy who died for her when he was only seventeen; actually he died of pneumonia, but he contracted pneumonia after spending long ours in front of her house when it was snowing.

After this painfull memory Gretta falls asleep, because she is overwhelmed by the intensity of these past feelings. 

#### Second section

Here there are Gabriel's thoughts when his wife is sleeping. The setting loses any temporal connotation, since in Gabriel's thoughts past, present and future intermingle. He looks at his wife and he realizes that she is no longer the pretty girl that Micheal Furey had fallen in love with, he thinks about Michael Furey, he thinks about the past, and he realies that he played a poor part in his wife's life: their relationship was emotional insipide in comparison to her love affair with Micheal Furey

He understand that it is better to live a short life, but full of emotions and passion, than living a longer life which is passionless. Living a life in which everything fades away and there is nothing memorable to look back on.

He thinks about the future, because he imagines the funeral of one of his aunts. He makes some other reflection on death.

He feels the noise of the snow which is tapping on the windopane. He looks out of the window and the story ends with him looking at the snow which is covering the city of Dublin.

When Gabriel looked at the snow he experienced another epiphany. He meditates upon the intimate insignificance of even the most intense moments of life. The snow becomes a powerful symbol which can be interpretive in many different ways:

- **purity**: because of its colour (white) it can be seen as a symbol of purity; it seems to clear everything;
- **death**: it can also be read as a symbol of death. The snow falls upon the living and the dead, making everything indistinguishable It bares everything and the city becomes a cemetery; death is like a great leveller because when we died, we are all equal and it does not matter if someone has been poor or rich during life; the snow dissolves itself when it melts, another link to death;
- **paralysis**: it can be also seen as a symbol of paralysis because everything seems dead; the reader has the impression that the living characters are actually spiritually dead, to the point that they are more dead than Michael Fury, he’s physically dead, but alive in Greta’s heart.

It is in Joyce symbolism that we see it’s experimentation with the language. In his symbolism he experiments, it’s very innovative, whereas his realism is traditional.
We have the symbolism of the snow and than the symbolism of the names of the characters. In the extract, Gabriel and Michael are highlighted in pink. Gabriel is the name of the angel that plays the trumpet of the last judgment, Michael is also the name of an angel.
At a certain point he thinks about going “westward”, which is also a symbol. “going west word” is an idiomatic expression, it means dying. This expression makes us identify Gabriel with Joyce himself, we have the idea that Gabriel represents what Joyce would have become if he hadn’t left Ireland.

- The expressions underlined in blu, presents some examples of Joyce realistic descriptions.
- Those highlighted in light blue includes Gabriel thoughts expressed in past continuous or past simple, and represents the present of the narration.
- Those highlighted in green, includes Gabriel thoughts expressed in past perfect, this represent the past of the narration.
- Highlighted in yellow are those Gabriel’s expressions referred to the future of the narration.
- The grey arrows are lines that includes a passage from an outer reality to an inner reality.
- The red dots indicate moments of epiphany

## *Ulysses*

It was published in 1922 and this work marks a turning point in his career because his career can be generally divided in 2 different periods:

- **First period** is characterised by a traditional approach and the most significant work of the first period is *Dubliners*; we can also includes *A portrait of the artist of a Young man*. The plot is still quite linear and the syntax is still quite logical. The language reflects everyday language.
- **Second period**: it begins with *Ulysses* because it is a linguistic experiment. It was banned in Britain and American when it was published because it was considered too complex and incomprehensible. After *Ulysses* he dedicated his life to an even more complex work, *Finnegans Wakes* because he wanted to keep the literary historians busy for the next 400 years.

What changes between the periods is only the language because the setting is Dublin for both of them.

*Ulysses* takes as its material a single day, 16th June 1904,, the protagonists are two men and a woman, and the work is divided into three different sections, each one is dedicated to one of the central characters:

- **first section**: it is dedicated to Stephen Dedalus. “Steven” is the name of the first Christian martyr because we was accused of preaching a new religion. Also Stephen is treating badly by the Irish because tried to have a different approach to life. He is a craftsman (artigiano). Stephen has intellectual ambitions.
- **second section**: is about Leopold Bloom and he is an advertisement sales man. This morning he steps out of his house and starts wandering through the streets of Dublin and then he bumps into Stephen. They went into a brothel where they got drunk. Stephen had been evicted (sfrattato) from his house, so Leopold offers to take him into his house: so Leopold become a sort of protector father for Stephen. Leopold Bloom stands for Ulysses and Stephen stands for Telemachus.
- **third section**: it is focused on Leopold wife Molly Bloom which stands for Penelope (Ulysse’s wife). The difference is that Penelope was faithful to her husband while Leopold wife isn’t. While Leopold walks around the streets of Dublin, she spends time with another man.

This works wants to reproduce the classical one (made by Homer) and in fact Joyce Ulysses is structured in 18 episodes which parallel the same episodes that we find in Homers’ Odyssey even though in Joyce’s works we do not find the same order of Homer’s work.
This parallelism has got comic and parodic connotation because Joyce wants to show that modern men faces the same tragedies, triumphs, conflicts and problems of the classical heroes; the difference is that a modern man is no hero and he cannot rely on the God to help him through his struggles.

# Virginia Woolf

Together with Joyce, Virginia Woolf is considered one of the greatest and innovative novelist of her time. 

She continued Joyce’s experimentation with the stream of Consciousness, but their achievements were quite distinct: Joyce was more concerned with language, while Woolf was more interested in the contrast between outer reality and inner reality.

She was born in London, in 1882, and she didn’t go to school, being educated at home, because her father was an influential literary critic, and he educated Virginia.
She had the opportunity to read a lot in her father’s library, she had the opportunity to meet many men of letters during her life. 

She grew up in a cultural atmosphere of great refinement.

When she was 13 her mother died, and she had a strong breakdown. From that moment the cloud of mental instability shadowed her life. She had hallucinations, she heard phantom voices.

In addition she also suffered form severe migraine attacks.

When her father died, she moved to Bloomsbury, which is a district in London, where she founded a circle of intellectuals, that became known as *The Bloomsbury book*. The group included intellectuals in general, and Virginia Woolf married one of its members, Leonard Woolf, in 1912.

All the members of the book were anti-Victorian and unconventional, both in their view of art and in their way of living.

With her husband she founded The Hogarth Press, a publishing house that published most of her novels.

In 1915 she published her first novel, which is *The Voyage Out*, and then she tried to kill herself. This novel was still traditional, but then this novel was followed by a series of modernist masterpieces

- *Mrs Dalloway* (1925)
- *To the Lighthouse* (1927): is probably Woolf’s most celebrated novel; its most interesting aspect is its treatment of time: the novel is cantered on a single event, a planned excursion to the lighthouse, which happens to be postponed
- *Orlando* (1928): this novel recounts the adventures of Orlando, who is a man who lives over three hundred years; one morning he wakes up and he find out to be a woman; in this novel Virginia Woolf explores the themes of androgyny: the idea she develops is that human personality is too complex to be classified as male or female, and it’s always a combination of female and male aspects
- *The Waves* (1931): its her last novel, and here she draws a link between her creative and artistic process and her mental illness

She was also a great literary critic, and her most important essays are collected in *The Common Reader* (1925)

She is important because she was a supporter of the feminist cause: she wrote two important essays: *A Room of One’s Own* (1929) and *Three Guinaes* (1938), all based on the idea of feminism.

She became more and more subjected to periods of depression, and in 1941 she drowned herself in the River Ouse, near her house. Before committing suicide she wrote a touching letter in which she said she could go on living in that way.
> Death is the only experience I shall never transcribe  

## Features of her novels

1. **Inconsistent plots**: she rejected traditional eventful plot, because she was not interested in external elements, but she was concerned with her characters’ inner life
2. **The shift of the viewpoint inside the characters’ minds**: she was interested in reproducing her characters’ flow of thoughts, memories and reflections
3. **The abandonment of the chronological order of events**, because our mind jumps from past to present and future continously
4. **Highly evocative and figurative language**

Her literary technique was based on the so called **moments of being**: they are the equivalent of Joyce’s epiphany, they are moments of intensity, perception or vision which illuminate our lives

Her task as a writer is taking an ordinary mind on an ordinary day and examine the myriad of impression that the mind receives form the outer world.
> Examine for a moment an ordinary mind on an ordinary day. The mind receives a myriad of impressions. From all sides they come, an incessant shower of innumerable atoms

## *Mrs Dalloway*

The actions of Mrs Dalloway is limited to the events of a single day in central London. The protagonist is Clarissa Dalloway: a middle aged woman, the wife of a politician, and she belongs to the upper-class.

The novel opens on a June morning, as Calarissa leaver her home to buy some flowers for the party she had organised in the evening.
During the day Clarissa is captured in different moods, her thoughts are described, and we also see her through the eyes and thoughts of other characters.

The other main character is Septimus Smith, whose day is contrasted by Clarissa’s day. The novel is based on the contrast between the description of these two days.
He is shell shocked, he is traumatised by the experience of the war, and he is a broken man.
He has been treated for his nervous disorders, first by doctor Holmes, who understood nothing about his pain, and then he has been treated by an other insensitive nerve specialist, Sir William Bradshaw, that wanted to hospitalise him.

At the end of the day Septimus commit suicide, by jumping out of the window of his room.

Clarissa and Septimus belongs to two different narrative lines, but they become linked to each other as Virginia Woolf constantly shift from Clarissa thoughts
Only at the very end of the novel the two different narrative lines intermingled, when we have the **climax the story**, represented by the party scene.
One of the guests of the party is Sir William Bradshaw, and he brought the news of Septimus suicide. Clarissa is quite irritated by this news, because the party was supposed to be a happy moment, but now death is present in the middle of the party.
She goes into a small room and she starts thinking about Septimus’ life, and how intolerable his life was: she experiences a **moment of being**. As he embraces death, she embraces life, she understands the importance of life.
She was almost happy that he committed suicide, since she understood the importance of life. His choosing to die is inseparable for her acceptance of life.

Even if their lives were completely different, they were absolutely linked. Septimus’ death is like the halo that illuminates Clarissa’s life, but these two characters are very different: she shows to be always aware of the contrast between her thoughts and exterior reality, on the contrary Septimus is unable to distinguish between these two different reality, and he is unable to give order to his past experiences and to his thoughts.

### T: *Clarissa and Septimus*

![Schermata 2021-05-30 alle 18.03.21](/assets/Schermata%202021-05-30%20alle%2018.03.21.png)![Schermata 2021-05-30 alle 18.03.29](/assets/Schermata%202021-05-30%20alle%2018.03.29_17bg9tikv.png)

Clarissa Dalloway decides to buy flowers herself for the party she is going to give in the evening. She goes into Mulberry's florist shop and is greeted by Miss Pym. Clarissa enjoys the various perfumes and colours of the many flowers. She suddenly hears a noise similar to a pistol shot in the street. Miss Pym looks apologetic, as if the loud motor cars were her fault.
Clarissa and seeral other people turn to observe the mysterious person passing in a luxury car. They wonder whether it is the Queen or the Prime Minister behind the blinds.
Septimus Warren Smith, a veteran of WWI, also hears the car backfire. He suffers from shell shock, a mental illness caused by the horrors of war, and believes he is responsible for the traffic congestion the passin car causes. His young Italian wife, Lucrezia, is embarassed by his odd manner and also frightened, since Septimus has recently threatened to kill himself.

This extract is divided into five part:

- **line 1-23**: Mrs Dalloway’s visit at the florist’s is interrupted by the explosion of a tyre in the street
- **line 24-37**: various people’s reactions to the explosion and their speculations about who might be in the car
- **line 38-41**: Introduction of Septimus Warren Smith
- **line 42-53**: The busy traffic in the street and Septimus’s thoughts
- **line 54-73**: Description of Lucrezia’s appearance and thoughts. She is worried because Septimus wants to kill himself.

One of the most interesting aspect in reading Woolf’s novel is how she treats time. The **treatment of time** is a fundamental concept that characterised her style.

This extract is from the beginning of the novel: as she walks around London, her physical trajectory towards the flower shop is constantly interrupted by the interior tunnels that open up in her mind. Woolf is brilliantly able to portray the interior time and the contrast between the interior time (subjective) and the exterior time (objective)
As Clarissa walks around London, her physical trajectory towards the flower shop is constantly interrupted by the interior tunnels that open up in her mind. She is thrown into the depths of the past and the uncertain terrain of the future. The dilated quality of her interior time is interrupted by the chimes of Big Ben. The chimes of Big Ben represents chronological time, which contrasts her interior time.

We are informed by Septimus’ illness as he hears the explosion of the tyre, as he hears the explosion of this tyre, he experiences a series of feelings, such as **alienation**, and since the rumor reminded him of the war, he totally **panics**: he was paralysed in the middle of the street.
He also feels **guilty** because he thinks that he is the one responsible for the traffic congestion.
As his wife tries to bring him back to reality, he became very **angry** to her, and then he feels **madness**, since he says that he will kill himself.

The **narrative technique** is characterised by **association**; the narrative is organised piece by piece through association; the point of view constantly shifts from one character to an other.
We are catapulted into the characters’ mind; in Virginia Woolf novel we still find the figure of a narrator that gives order to the characters thoughts (different from Joyce’s style).

The extract is rich in dashes, semicolons, questions marks, exclamations, very short sentences, that are meant to reproduce the working of the mind.

### T: *Clarissa’s party*

![Schermata 2021-05-30 alle 18.05.05](/assets/Schermata%202021-05-30%20alle%2018.05.05.png)![Schermata 2021-05-30 alle 18.05.16](/assets/Schermata%202021-05-30%20alle%2018.05.16.png)

This is taken from the very end of the novel: all the guests have finally arrived to the party, but the festive atmosphere is ruined by the news of Septimus’ suicide.

Semptimus’ death is described through a series of expressions that emphasise the **brutality of the act**.

- **line 5**: His body was wounded by ‘the rusty spikes’ and smashed onto the ground
- **line 5**: *Up had flashed the ground*: inversion
- **line 5**: *blundering, bruising*: alliteration
- **line 6**: *a thud, thud, thud*: onomatopoeia and repetition
- **line 6**: *a suffocation of blackness*: metaphor

Mrs Dalloway mentally comments on the event: she is worried about the fact that death is now present in the middle of her party which was supposed to be a happy moment. Then she identifies with the young man and wonders why he has killed himself. Later on, she looks out of the window and sees an old woman staring at her from the window in the opposite room; the old woman is alone and she is going to bed. Then Clarissa hears her guests *laughing and shouting*; the clock *striking the hour* (**lines 51-4**). Mrs Dalloway is convinced that nevertheless the people at the party would go on living.  She understands that he payed to much attention to appearance and to social life.
Finally she resolves to come back to her guests.

At the very end of the novel, the difference between these two characters became very evidente.
We can connect Clarissa to an ideal of superficiality, whilee Septimus to inability to conform. An other opposition is sanity mental and illness. He is not able to overcome his pain and to find any meaning in his dramatic war experience and in fact he commit suicide.
She is the wife of a politician while Septimus rejects society: he is totally alineated for rejection of existence and final self acceptance.
She is ready to go on, after the moment of being she is a new person

## Feminism

Feminism is the belief in the social, economic, and political equality of sexes.
Historically women have been considered second class individue, and have been denied opportunity of furthering their studies, they were told that their home was the place where they belong to, and in different situation women have been subjected to men.

This movement developed in different waves:
- 1st wave of Feminism: late 19th century/early 20th century
- 2nd wave of Feminism: 1960s – 1980s
- 3rd wave of Feminism: mid 1990s
- 4th wave of Feminism: 2010s

### 1st wave of feminism

The first wave of feminism is focused on women struggle for the right to vote. Emmeline Parkhurst help women to organize themselves to get the right to vote. They started to protest in more violent ways, which challenged the ideal of domesticity.

The outbreak of WWI actually helped women in their process of emancipation . A lot of men were mobilised to go in role, and women replaced those men at work, and they proved as efficient as men. They were able to take new roles.
Also on the front line they proved fundamental as nurses.

Thanks to their role in the WWI they were able to break down all the remaining opposition to their cause.

In UK

- 1918: women over 30 gained the right to vote.
- 1928: suffrage to women over 21.

In USA

- 1919: The 19th amendment was added to the American constitution in 1919 and ratified in 1920.

### 2nd wave of feminism

It emerges in the 60s and it continued into the 80s. The difference with the first wave of feminism was that whether the first wave was totally focussed on legal rights, the second wave of feminism, that coincided with the **women’s lib movement**, touched every area of experience, politics, work, family, sexuality.

It started with the protests against the Miss America pageant in Atlantic City in 1968, since they thought that it was a cattle parade. They were against with the idea that reduced women to objects of beauty dominated by a patriarchy that sought to keep them in the home.

This second wave of feminism led women to reach many goals:
- greater access to education;
- more women in positions of leadership in different fields;
- women obtained more financial independence: in the past women didn’t own anything, since everything was of the male members of the family; in the 70s many laws were issued and women were finally recognise their financial independence;
- abortion rights, access to the contraceptive pills;
- many institution were founded, devouted to the protection and the promotion of women right: this is important, since in the past there weren’t organisations; 
- discourse about the importance of women’s right started to be on the popular level.

### 3rd wave of feminism

It emerges in the mid 1990s, because there was still some work to be done.
The peculiarity of this third way is that women rejected all the constructs that were developed in the past by the feminist of the first and the second wave.

Feminist of the third wave, refused to be identified as feminist, they rejected standardise objectivity.
They were against all those definition that had been provided in the past.

They found the word “feminist” limiting and exclusionary. They adopted a series of elements that were rejected in the past by the feminists of the first and second wave: lipstick, high heels, low cut necklines.
The idea they wanted to promote is that is possible to wear a push-up bra and a brain at the same time

In the past the use of lipstick was viewed as a form of male oppression.

### 4th wave of feminism

It emerges after 2010. The main feature is that feminists started to campaign on the web: it is strongly connected with the advent and the widespread of social media; they provided a new form of discussion, local stories can be spread worldwide.

Social media promote an idea of interconnection among women.

## Feminism and Virginia Woolf

Virginia Woolf contributed to the feminist cause since she denounced the role of subordination that women were subjected to. She was a veritable heroin to many feminists.
She was concerned to women’s position in literature.

In her diary she wrote that she was the only woman in England to say what she like: she wanted other women to freely express themselves.

She is in between the first and second wave of feminism. She took part in the campaigns of the first wave, but she is considered a forerunner of the second wave of feminism.

Her greatest contribution to feminism is represented by the essay *A room of one’s own*.
It was published in 1929, and it was based on two lectures that Virginia Woolf gave on university about women and fiction.

The style is peculiar and very innovative, since it actually seems a novel. The boundaries between criticism and fiction are extremely blurred in this essay.
This aspect is evidente since Woolf’s argument is made by a fictional character, Mary, which is the protagonist of this essay. She goes to the British museum, since she wants to know everything that has been said about women throughout history.

When she arrives at the British museum, she finds only books written by men: everything that had been said on women was said by men.
She understands that history and literature was male constructs, and she praises those few women who were able to became writers (Jane Austen, the Bronte Sisters) and than she analyses the causes for this minority of women writers.
The main reasons are related to socio-economic factors. They have been denied the opportunity to study, in the past women were often channeled in lowkey jobs, their role was to look after their children o their parents.
Because of this women’s creativity has been inhibited.

To really express themselves women need some privacy: a space where they can go and give bent to their emotions and thoughts. This space is represented by **a room of one’s own**.

### *A room of one’s own*
According to Virginia Woolf, women’s creativity has been inhibited by centuries of prejudices. To illustrate this point, she makes an example: she invents a story about Judith Shakespeare, a talented fictional sister of Shakespeare. Judith was as talented as her brother: she had the potential to became a famous writer, just like William, but she was denied the opportunities that William was offered. 

William went to school, he could study, whereas she wasn’t allowed to go to School. Virgil a Woolf recounts an episode in which Judith was even punished by her parents because they have found her with a book in her hands.
She was told that books were none of her business.

She wanted to became a writer, but her parents wanted her to marry a man that she didn’t actually love. She had been betrothed by her parents, and she was finally forced to commit suicide.

By illustrating this fictional story about Judith Shakespeare, Virginia Woolf was able to demonstrate the inequalities between women and men. Judith finally committed suicide because of the way society was structured against women.

Women need money and a **room of one’s own** to express themselves creativity. There is a mantra that is repeated in the essay: to be a writer a woman needs 40000 P a year, and then a room of one’s own, that is a space where women can be Women. They are no longer mothers or daughters, but only Women.

The image of the room actually implies an oxymoric connotation: on a first level, this room refers to a space where women can retreat and enjoy some privacy, away from her domestic duties; the real meaning of this metaphoric image refers to the possibility for women to invade spaces that historically were considered the spheres of men: it is not a place where to be confined, but it is an image for women to break confines and boundaries.
Women have to trespass trashows, to break the boundaries, so that women and men are finally really equal.

## *To the Lighthouse*

She published it in 1927, and the most important element of this novel is the treatment of time. The novel is divided into three sections:
- the window
- time passes
- the Lighthouse

**The first section** (which is the longest one) recounts the events of a single day. We find the **Ramsays**, that are a family, and they are spending their holidays in their summerhouse in the Hebrides (a group of islands near Scottland). One of the children wants to go to the Lighthouse, but because of bad wheather condition the trip has to be postponed.
It is the longest one because time is dilating because Virginia Woolf was mainly interested in the character's interior time.

The **second section** recounts with brevity the events that take place in a span of 10 years. We are informed that Ms Ramsay died, her eldest daughter also died, and one of the sons died as a victim of WWI, and this is an occasion to make a portrait of Britain in the world years, describing the athmospere of devastation boughts by the Great War.

The **third section** is based on the events of a single days. In the final section the family returns to the house in the Hebrides, Mr Ramsay finally goes to the Lighthouse with James, the child that 10 years earlier was so excited about this escursion. We find some guests that where present in the first section, such as Lily Briscoe, a painter; in the first section she started to make a portrait of Ms Ramsay and her children, and ten years later she finished the portrait.

The plot is not really relevant, the most important theme is the treatment of time, since Virginia Woolf delate and compress the time.

**Virginia Woolf symbolism**: the main symbol is the **lighthouse**, which is the alternation of light and darkness: this alternation is evident from the structure of the novel, which is A-B-A: the first section represents the long lightbeams of the lighthouse, then after this beams of light there is a pause of darkness, represented by the second section, the war years, and after this short pause we have again a flash of light, which is represented by the third section.
This alternation is also evidente in an episode that we find in the first section: Ms Ramsay has to tell her son James that they can't go to the Lighthouse. She starts thinking about the words that she can use to explain him that the trip had to be postponed. As she thinks about it she defines herself as a core of darkness, which represents her inner-self, which is different from her public self.

This novel is about the difficulty and the complexity of human relationship, because we are all thorned between our innerself and our publicself.

An other symbol is the **sea**, which is omnipresent, it is the background for every scene. The incessant movement of the waves represents the movement of Woolf's prose. Her prose was characterized by shifting different temporal places, the use of interior monologue.

# George Orwell

George Orwell was the pseudonym (*nom de plume*) of Eric Arthur Blair.
He published his first book after this pseudonym, becoming famous as George Orwell, and still today he is most widely known as Orwell.

He was born in 1903 in India, but he was educated in England. On living school he went to work as a superintendent in Burma, in Britain police force.
He soon realises that the British empire was based on a false and inequitable concept, so he developed socialist ideas, and he finally resigned. He decided to go back to Europe.

He developed a sense of guilt after his experience in Burma, and the idea that he had to make a process of expiation. He lived in Paris and in London, and disgusted with the snobbery and hypocrisy of the middle class (which he belonged to), and so he decided to carry out a social experiment: he decided to live the life of a poorer person, because he wanted to experience first hand poverty.

This experiment form the subject of his first book: *Down and Out in Paris and London* (1933). In this book he made a face to poverty.
Then he published *Burmese Days*, where he describes his experience in Britain police force in Burma, and then he published two novels in which he exposes his socialist views: *Clergyman’s Daughter* and *Keep the Aspidistra Flying*.

During the Spanish civil war, he worked as a reporter in Spain, and he also fought on the side of the Republicans against Franco, and this experience produces an other non narrative work: *Homage to Catalonia*.

The WWII broke out, and during it he wrote *Animal Farm* (1945), in which he criticise the Russian revolution, even thought he continued to hold socialist views. In this novel he satirise the Russian revolution, attacking the principles of Russian communism.

He published his masterpiece **_Nineteen Eighty-Four_** in 1949.

## *Animal Farm*
This is a political and allegorical fable.

There is a farm with some animals, but the animals, tired of being exploited by their human master, Mr Jones, decided to get rid of him, and they decided to set up a new community, ran by animals, based on egalitarian principle.
The animals make a rebellion, led by the pigs (that are the smartest animals in this fable): Napoleon and Snowball; critics find that these two pigs were an allegorical representation of Trotsky e Stalin. At a certain point Napoleon get rid of Snowball, starting ruling as a dictator, concentrating all the power in his hands. Basically the pigs restore a form of totalitarianism.

This fable ends with the pigs playing cards with men, and with the others animals looking at the pigs, who have became indistinguishable from men.
At the end of the fable pigs stand on their hind legs, which is remarkable since at the beginning their motto was “two legs bad, four legs good”, but by the end it became “four legs good, but two legs better”.

With this fable Orwell was able to show the process of corruption of the ideal of Russian Revolution, and he also demonstrated the tendency of create class stratification and class tyranny.

## *Nineteen Eighty-Four*
This is Orwell masterpiece. Written in 1948, and then he published it in 1949.
The story is settled in the future (1984), and in this future the world is divided into three main blocks: Oceania, Eurasia and Eustasia, superstates that control the whole word.

London is located in the superstate of Oceania, which corresponds to British empire and the americas. It is ruled by The Party, a small minority that controls every aspects of human life. Citizens are controlled through tele screens and microphone hidden everywhere, capturing everything.
The leader is Big Brother. Posters of him are put everywhere, with the caption ‘Big Brother is Watching you’.

The protagonist of the novel is Winston Smith. He works at the ministry of truth and his job consists in manipulating and revising historical facts, so that they fit with The Party’s official view of the past. 
The three superpowers are constantly at war, alliances changes: as the novel progresses we discover that this perpetual state of was is an illusion to keep people in a state of subordination and subjection.
As alliances change, the Party want to make history adhere to the current version of the past.

In the second part of the novel, Winston develops the idea of smashing the system. He has a illecit love affair with a Woman, Julia, which is also a dissenter: in this distopian society, sex is prohibited: sex can be conceived as an act of procreation, [in caso contrario] it is forbidden.
Julia and Winston have sex in a room which appears to have no telescreen, but in reality there is an hidden camera: they are discovered, arrested, and sent to Room 101, a space where people who committed illegal action were confronted with their worst fear.

In this room Winston is tortured, and brainwashed into conformity again. At the end of the novel we find Winston Smith living as an automaton, with is spirit finally broken.

### Themes

- **Critique of totalitarianism**: the value of 1984 lays in the detailed account that Orwell is able to provide about the political method of totalitarianism; he is able to describe what the methods of a totalitarian system are: how though is controlled, how privacy is invaded and how individuality is denied.
- **Use of mass media as agents of mass oppression**: in this novel the media have the function of brainwashing the population with paradoxical slogans; Orwlee shows how mass media can be used as means of political propaganda.
- **Censorship**: the Party controls the information that is delivered to its citizens, and the ministry of truth is actually concerned with the tramsission of untruth; the government edis what has been said about the present, the future and the past.
- **Sexual repression**: sex is prohibitted as a form of entertainment; sex is allowed only when it is conceveid as an act of procreation.
- **Subordination**: people have no freedom in this society.

Even though the novel is set in the future, Orwell only ecoing the horrors of nazism, fascism and communism.

### Language

Language plays a crucial role in this novel: the Party invented its own language, called "Newspeak": a langauge with limited vocabulary, because of troublesome words are removed and vanished (freedom, equality, etc...): they are dangerous, they might produce dangerous consequencies for the Party stability.

Newspeak is linked to **doublethink**: it is the act of holding simultanously two contraddictory ideas and believing in both idea simultanously and absolutely, with the same intensity, even if this two ideas are totally contraddictory.

### T: *Big Brother is watching you*

![Schermata 2021-05-30 alle 18.07.10](/assets/Schermata%202021-05-30%20alle%2018.07.10.png)![Schermata 2021-05-30 alle 18.07.19](/assets/Schermata%202021-05-30%20alle%2018.07.19.png)

The extract is taken from the beginning of the novel, and shows the city of London at it is seen by Winston Smith: London is located in Airstrip One, which is a province of Oceania, and the novel begins with this description of the city, which is in a state of desolation and decade.

We find Winston Smith who is going home after his workday, it is one o'clock, the sun is shining but even the sun is distopian: it is a **cold sun**; temperature is very cold, and there is an image of Winston who raises is shoulder up and lowers his chin not to feel the cold.

Winston Smith is 39 yo, he is physically weak, he is a smallish meager figure. He lives in a flat on the seventh floor, but he takes the stairs because the lift is out of order. Electricity is often catched of during the day, by the Party, in order to save money. He have to stop several times, since he is weak.

He is wearing the Party uniform, a pair of blue overalls. His memories have been erased, he annot remember anything about his own past. We are informed that he cannot remember when London started to be in this state of degradation, he can't even remember since when Oceania is in war.
Since past is always modified by the party, its impossible for citizens to had clear memory.

**Winston Smith** is a symbolic name: the name *Winston* reminds of Winston Churchill, while *Smith* is one of the most english surname: he stands for a man of the streets, he represents the whole humanity. He is a modern anti-hero.

He lives in a building which is in terrible condition, it always smells of boil cabbage and old rag mats. At the end of the hallway there is a poster with the image of Big Brother.
When he returns home, he ears a voice: every house has telescreens which can transmitt images and sounds but which can also capture images and sounds. This telescreens constantly trasmitt a voice which reproduce the Party ideals. These telescreens could not be swiched off, never, only volume can be regulated.

They couldn't know when they could be watched or overheard. There is no privacy neither freedom.

London is in a state of degradation: there is a general atmosphere of squalore, mismanagement (elettricity, lift); streets are covered with dust, the rooms of the buildings are covered with [willowherb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilobium): we have the idea of a city that is rotty. In the sky there are always elicopters controlling the citizens, and the city is colorless: the only colors are those of the posters of Big Brothers.

These posters contain the message "BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU", to remind citizens that they are always under sorvelliance.

The three slogan of the Party are:

- **War is peace**: by keeping the country on a state of war with the others superstates, the party is able to maintain the peace in its territory; war has to be seen positevly by citizens
- **Freedom is slavery**: this slogan is a sort of a subconscious discouragement, since the part want people not to desire freedom: people have to think that freedom is something negative;
- **Ignorance is strenght**: knowing too much is dangerous; the Party want its citizens to remain ignorant so they don't develop dangerous ideals.

There poster of slogans are interesting to analyze, since they remind of the power of advertisment in presente days. That's why this novel is so relevant today

### Link with civics: Freedom of the press

Orwell is a committed writer: he thought that is writing could be turned into a sort of politcal weapon, and so he believed that the language to be used had to be clear, simple and direct. He had leftist sympatis, but even though he thought that the writer had to maintain an independent view: he is not supposed to follow a party line.

In this novel we see how Orwell deals with the importance of a **free press**: in this novel there is no press freedom, since the Party controls any information which is delivered to its citizens, and we see how in so doing the party is able to get control on the present, the future and the past.

**Press freedom** refers to the ability of journalists to report freely on matters of public interest; press freedom is also derived of people to access informations. It belongs to every human being.
In order to make informed decision, people need to gather information: mass media are fondamental in this process.
Press freedom is a pillar of any functioning democracy. It is an indicator of a functioning democracy. 

This concept can be included into **freedom of expression**, that is afundamental human right, recognized in the *Universal declaration of Human Rights* (1948)

> Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and to seek, receive and impart information through any media and regardless of frontiers.

This article extabilish the importance of freedom of expression.

Freedom of the press is not a principle that is nationally included in the Constitutions of all democratic countries: Italy has an article in its constitution that mention the right of press freedom, while the UK have no contitutional garantee to press freedom.
Governments are very aware of the power of mass media, and they tend always to exert a form of control on mass media. Moreover non democratic countries have no right of free press.

United Nation instituted, on May the 3rd, the **World Press Freedom Day**, free press is not an optional right, but it is something that is important to protect.

# Aldous Huxley

He was born in Surrey in 1894, into a family of noted biologits and natural scientists.
He was physically weak in his eyes, and when he was young he became nearly blind, and so he wasn't able to follow a scientific career, but he succeeded into graduing in english in Oxford, deciding to became a writer.

His most famous novel is *Brave New World* (1932). During his life he published novels, essays and poems.
This novel is a mixture of distopian, science fiction and philosopical essay.

In the late 40s he moved to California, when he developed an interest into misticism and para-psychology.

He finally died in 1963, the same day that the american president Kennedy was assasinated, and so his death passed almost unnoticed.
It is as a novelist that he is mostly remembered, with his most succesful novel is *Brave new world*. There is doubt whether we can consider him a novelist in the real sense of the term: critics agree that Huxley is not novelist in the common sense of the word, they prefer to consider him a novelist of ideas.

**Novels of ideas** are novel based on a certain idea, so they revolve around the develpment of a certain point of view. 

## *Brave new world*

In *Brave new world* he develop the idea of the danger of **scientific progress**: he wanted to denounce the danger of the scientific progress. It is a science fiction novel in which Huxley portray an alarming picture of a future society: he describes a futuristic society in which technological and scientific progress have taken control over individual life.

*Brave new world* is a quotation from Shakespeare's play *The Tempest*: these words are pronounced by Miranda, the Daughter of Prospero. Since she was a child she lived alone, exiled on an island with her father: the first time she was other people she exclame: "Oh brave new world, that has such people in it".
Shakespeare is the greates english writer, he is the symbol of art, so probably with this title Huxley wanted to remind the reader about the fact that art is denied in the futuristic society he describes.

In this society technology and scientific progress had reach their utmost, everything is well structured and well organized, but people have lost their most authentic qualities, and they acts like puppets. 

The story is set in the seventh century AF (After Ford, the inventor of the modern factory system and of its essential organizational principle: the assembly line; he is regarded as a sort of deity in this story). Society is well structured, and it is based on stability, which is achieved through a specific cast classification system. It is a hierarchical society. 
- At the top we find the **alphas** and **betas**, they are the intellectual and the administrators, they are the most intelligent and the most physically perfect men and women.
- Below there are the **gammas**.
- At the bottom there are **deltas** and **epsilons**: they represents the manual workers, almost slaves. They accomplish the humbless tasks, and this is their role

People are born artificially, through artificial process: babies are produced and drawn in bottles, and even before they came into existance, they are brainwashed to conform to the cast they are predetermed to. They must be happy with their cast, they must like it and accept it. From the very beginning, even before being actually born, they are manipulated so that they are happy with their predetermined role.

The second key concept is **happiness**: everyone must be happy. Happiness is achieved through the consumption of a drug called **soma**, it is a sort of allucinogenon, that produces feelings of wellbeing, happiness, sexual promiscuity. Sex is seen as a form of mindless entertainment.

Art, literature, phylosophy are prohibitted in this society, since it might ruin the conditioning of every person.

The protagonist is **Bernard Marx**, an alpha-plus speciment, but he is dissatisfied with this antiseptic world, so one day he decides to visit a reservation in New Mexico. A reservation is a place, that is kept as the world was before scientific progress. Here he meets a savage, called John, and he decides to take John with him in London (which is the setting in place).

In London **John** is firstly fascinated by the world, but then he realises that it is not an happy world, so he rebels against its lack of freedom, passion, individuality, privacy, conformity.
He decides to live in an abandoned light house, he stats to lead a sort of Robinson Crusoe like existence, but he soon turnes into a sort of attraction to turists, and so he finally commits suicide: he understands that there is no possibility of being happy. There is no way out from this world.

### Themes

**Fordism**: with this reference of a mass production system that in this case is not applied to cars but to human beings: Henry Ford is a deity, who splits time; he is regarded as the most important person in the world, for his invenction of assembly line. Fordism replaced religion.

**Progress**, and in particular the effects of the scientific progress on the individual; tipically progress is regarded as something positive, but in this case Huxley emphasises the negative consequences related to an extreme belief in scientific progress.

**Technology**: Huxley wants to highlight the dangers of our worship for technology to the decadence of art, literature, phylosophy; technology is became the main value of the society.

**Totalitarianism**: this is a society characterized by an all-powerful state. It's similar to *1984* by Orwell. Orwell focused on a form of political totalitarianism, whil Huxley was more concerned with a technological totalitarianism.

### Features

It is characterized by a mixture of different literary genres: fable, science fiction, philosophical essay.

Its language varies from the clinically scientific to the satirical. Huxley's narrator often introduces veiled criticism of the world he is describing through particular comments or choice of a phrase.
The language varies in this novel. 

An other feature is that we can consider it a **prophetic book**: it is prophetic both in the long and in the short term.
On a short perspective, *Brave New World* anticipated the nazi policy of producing an arian master race, devoid of inferior individual. This arian master race was devoid of inferior individual.
In a long term, this novel anticipated contemporary biological manipulation. It anticipated the possibility of human cloning.

It is both an **utopian** and a **dystopian** novel. This society is a perfect society, where everything is perfectly organized, based on happiness. This happiness is possibile as long as no one questions the pillars on which this society is built, and that's why it is actually dystopian.

**Mental conditioning** is not invented by Huxley, but he took inspiration from the studies of a behavioural psychologists, Ivan Pavlov, who carried out experiments mainly on dogs; he wanted to condition the behaviour of dogs, through a system of punishment and rewards; he demonstrated how it is possible to condition someone's behaviour through this system.
Huxley showed how such research might be applied for dobious ends.

### T: *An unforgettable lesson*

> The nurses stiffened to attention as the D.H.C. came in.
> "Set out the books," he said curtly.
> In silence the nurses obeyed his command. Between the rose bowls the books were duly set out–a row of nursery quartos opened invitingly each at some gaily coloured image of beast or fish or bird.
> "Now bring in the children."
> They hurried out of the room and returned in a minute or two, each pushing a kind of tall dumb-waiter laden, on all its four wire-netted shelves, with eight-month-old babies, all exactly alike (a Bokanovsky Group, it was evident) and all (since their caste was Delta) dressed in khaki.
> "Put them down on the floor."
The infants were unloaded.
> "Now turn them so that they can see the flowers and books."
> Turned, the babies at once fell silent, then began to crawl towards those clusters of sleek colours, those shapes so gay and brilliant on the white pages. As they approached, the sun came out of a momentary eclipse behind a cloud. The roses flamed up as though with a sudden passion from within; a new and profound significance seemed to suffuse the shining pages of the books. From the ranks of the crawling babies came little squeals of excitement, gurgles and twitterings of pleasure.
> The Director rubbed his hands. "Excellent!" he said. "It might almost have been done on purpose."
> The swiftest crawlers were already at their goal. Small hands reached out uncertainly, touched, grasped, unpetaling the transfigured roses, crumpling the illuminated pages of the books. The Director waited until all were happily busy. Then, "Watch carefully," he said. And, lifting his hand, he gave the signal.
> The Head Nurse, who was standing by a switchboard at the other end of the room, pressed down a little lever.
> There was a violent explosion. Shriller and ever shriller, a siren shrieked. Alarm bells maddeningly sounded.
The children started, screamed; their faces were distorted with terror.
> "And now," the Director shouted (for the noise was deafening), "now we proceed to rub in the lesson with a mild electric shock."
> He waved his hand again, and the Head Nurse pressed a second lever. The screaming of the babies suddenly changed its tone. There was something desperate, almost insane, about the sharp spasmodic yelps to which they now gave utterance. Their little bodies twitched and stiffened; their limbs moved jerkily as if to the tug of unseen wires.
> "We can electrify that whole strip of floor," bawled the Director in explanation. "But that's enough," he signalled to the nurse.
> The explosions ceased, the bells stopped ringing, the shriek of the siren died down from tone to tone into silence. The stiffly twitching bodies relaxed, and what had become the sob and yelp of infant maniacs broadened out once more into a normal howl of ordinary terror.
> "Offer them the flowers and the books again."
> The nurses obeyed; but at the approach of the roses, at the mere sight of those gaily-coloured images of pussy and cock-a-doodle-doo and baa-baa black sheep, the infants shrank away in horror, the volume of their howling suddenly increased.
> "Observe," said the Director triumphantly, "observe."
> Books and loud noises, flowers and electric shocks–already in the infant mind these couples were compromisingly linked; and after two hundred repetitions of the same or a similar lesson would be wedded indissolubly. What man has joined, nature is powerless to put asunder.
> "They'll grow up with what the psychologists used to call an 'instinctive' hatred of books and flowers. Reflexes unalterably conditioned. They'll be safe from books and botany all their lives." The Director turned to his nurses. "Take them away again."
> Still yelling, the khaki babies were loaded on to their dumb-waiters and wheeled out, leaving behind them the smell of sour milk and a most welcome silence.
> One of the students held up his hand; and though he could see quite well why you couldn't have lower-cast people wasting the Community's time over books, and that there was always the risk of their reading something which might undesirably decondition one of their reflexes, yet … well, he couldn't understand about the flowers. Why go to the trouble of making it psychologically impossible for Deltas to like flowers?
> Patiently the D.H.C. explained. If the children were made to scream at the sight of a rose, that was on grounds of high economic policy. Not so very long ago (a century or thereabouts), Gammas, Deltas, even Epsilons, had been conditioned to like flowers–flowers in particular and wild nature in general. The idea was to make them want to be going out into the country at every available opportunity, and so compel them to consume transport.
> "And didn't they consume transport?" asked the student.
> "Quite a lot," the D.H.C. replied. "But nothing else."
> Primroses and landscapes, he pointed out, have one grave defect: they are gratuitous. A love of nature keeps no factories busy. It was decided to abolish the love of nature, at any rate among the lower classes; to abolish the love of nature, but not the tendency to consume transport. For of course it was essential that they should keep on going to the country, even though they hated it. The problem was to find an economically sounder reason for consuming transport than a mere affection for primroses and landscapes. It was duly found.
> "We condition the masses to hate the country," concluded the Director. "But simultaneously we condition them to love all country sports. At the same time, we see to it that all country sports shall entail the use of elaborate apparatus. So that they consume manufactured articles as well as transport. Hence those electric shocks."
> "I see," said the student, and was silent, lost in admiration.

The exstract is taken from the second chapter, and the setting is a scientific lab; there is the director of the center, and he is with some students, because he wants to show them the process of mental conditioning used with babies belonging to the lower casts.

The director tells the nurs to put the babies on the floor, where there are roses and books with bright images, that were meant to attract the babies. At the beginning they are free to crawl. 
At a certain point the director gives a signal, the nurse presses a lever, and then the room is filled with the sound of an explosion. The children receive mild elettic shocks. 
After this the children start screaming and crying, their bodies moves spasmodically.

They want these babies to develop a feeling of hatery towards nature and books-
If they loved nature, they probably want to be happy and spending their day in nature, but since they are supposed to work they have to hate nature.
If people read, they might develop dangerous thoughts that might decondition their reflexes.

Students are lost in admiration. No one questions the logic behind this experiment, because everyone is brainwashed from their birth

# Universal Declaration of Human Rights

The **United Nations** is an international organization, designed to facilitate cohoperation in different fields, such as international laws, security, economic development, social progress, and human rights
This organization was founded after the end of WWWII, and it has an historical predecessor, the **league of nation**, which is internationally viewed as the forerunner of the United Nations.

After the WWII countries felt that a way had to be found to preserve the peace. In 1945 delegates from fifty nations gathered in San Francisco, determined to set up a new organization that would be really able to maintain the peace, and that would really help build a better world.
The main aim of the San Francisco conference was to produce a charter for a new organization that would be accetable to all countries. The process of writing this charter was monument, it took nearly months, from april to june. 
The most heated discussion regarded the right to vetal of the big five withing the security council. The UN is made up of different institution, and the security councile is one of the most important organs of this organization: it is made up of fifteen members: five are permanent, and the other ten members rotate. The five permanent (the big five) are United States, UK, France, China and Russia: they were the main powers after WWII, and for this reason they maintened that the role of preserving the peace fell most heavily on them.
The decision of the vetal right was taken with a qualified majority. Even thought this wasn't really democratic, it was still something to start with.

After the horrors of WWII all the nations were really motivated to find new strategies of cohoperation.

From the beginning to present days this organization has evolved: membership was left open to all peaceloving countries, and in fact today this organization is made up of 193 countries, almost the totality of the countries in the world.

This organization has evolved not only in terms of numbers of members, but also in terms of its fields of action. Among them we can include **Human Rights**, and the importance given by the UN to human rights is evidente from the founding charter, which was signed in San Francisco, and the from the **Universal Declaration of Human Rights**, which was signed in 1984 10th december.
This document is very important, because for the first time in history different nations worked together in this field to produce a common set of principles and rights. Basically all the nations didn't want history to repeat itself. They wanted to protect the whole world from future abuses like the ones that were carried out during WWII, in which millions of people were denied their basic rights, as human beings.

This declaration is made up of 30 articles

1. We are all born free and equal. We all have our own thoughts and ideas. We should all be treated in the same way.
1. These rights belong to everybody, whatever our differences.
1. We all have the right to life, and to live in freedom and safety.
1. Nobody has any right to make us a slave. We cannot make anyone else our slave.
1. Nobody has any right to hurt or torture us or treat us cruelly.
1. Everyone has the right to be protected by the law.
1. The law is the same for everyone. It must treat us all fairly.
1. We can all ask for the law to help us when we are not treated fairly.
1. Nobody has the right to put us in prison without a good reason, to keep us there or to send us away from our country.
1. If we are put on trial, this should be in public. The people who try us should not let anyone tell them what to do.
1. Nobody should be blamed for doing something until it has been proved. When people say we did a bad thing we have the right to show it is not true.
1. Nobody should try to harm our good name. Nobody has the right to come into our home, open our letters, or bother us, or our family, without a good reason.
1. We all have the right to go where we want to in our own country and to travel abroad as we wish.
1. If we are frightened of being badly treated in our own country, we all have the right to run away to another country to be safe.
1. We all have the right to belong to a country.
1. Every grown up has the right to marry and have a family if they want to. Men and women have the same rights when they are married, and when they are separated.
1. Everyone has the right to own things or share them. Nobody should take our things from us without a good reason.
1. We all have the right to believe in what we want to believe, to have a religion, or to change it if we wish.
1. We all have the right to make up our own minds, to think what we like, to say what we think, and to share our ideas with other people.
1. We all have the right to meet our friends and to work together in peace to defend our rights. Nobody can make us join a group if we don’t want to.
1. We all have the right to take part in the government of our country. Every grown up should be allowed to vote to choose their own leaders.
1. We all have the right to a home, enough money to live on and medical help if we are ill. Music, art, craft and sport are for everyone to enjoy.
1. Every grown up has the right to a job, to a fair wage for their work, and to join a trade union.
1. We all have the right to rest from work and to relax.
1. We all have the right to enough food, clothing, housing and health care. Mothers and children and people who are old, unemployed or disabled have the right to be cared for.
1. We all have the right to education, and to finish primary school, which should be free. We should be able to learn a career, or to make use of all our skills.
1. We all have the right to our own way of life, and to enjoy the good things that science and learning bring.
1. There must be proper order so we can all enjoy rights and freedoms in our own country and all over the world.
1. We have a duty to other people, and we should protect their rights and freedoms.
1. Nobody can take away these rights and freedoms from us.

The main **features** of these articles:

- human rights are universal and inalienable: they are universal since we are born with these rights, and every people posses these rights; they are inalienable since they cannot be taken away: you can't lose these rights
- they are indivisible: denial of one human rights inevitably empedes the enjoyment of others rigths: human rights are all equal in importance, they cannot be positioned in an hierarcical order.
- they are interdependent and interelated: together they contribute to a person's dignity, which cannot be reached if only one of these rigths is denied.

The UDHR has achieved the status of **customary international law**. The UDHR has achieved the status of **customary international law** [diritto internazionale consuetudinario]. This type of law refers to a series of legal implications that are legally binding even if there is not a written agreement.
In this case we do have a written document, but this declaration was issued by the general assembly of the UN, an organ of the UN: it is the most democratic organ in the UN, because all countries are represented in this council. The general assembly cannot issue resolutions that are legally binding.
In this case, this declaration has become legally binding for all the countries in the world. Some countries have actually incorporated in their consitution the principles codified by this declaration, but even when they don't have these principles explicitly mentioned in the national constitution, they are still expected to respect these principles.

# Samuel Becket

He was a novelist, a playwright and a critic, but it is as a playwright that he is most widely known.

He was born in Dublin in 1906 from a middlle class family, and he studied modern literature, and he specialized in French and Italian. After his studies at university he went to Paris to work as a lecturer of english. He travelled through Germany, French, Ireland, England, and then he finally settled in France. 

He published his early novels in english, but then he turned to french, and it is in French that he first published his masterpieces: *En attendant Godot* (1952, published in english in 1955 as *Waiting for Godot*) and *Fin de Partie* (1957, published in english in 1958 as *End Game*). He became famous for the first play. 
He first published these plays in France and then he translated it in english.

In 1969 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literatura, and he finally died in 1989.

Some critics consider Beckett as the last modernist. He is somewhere in between modernism and present age.

## The theatre of the absurd

He is considered the main representative of the **theatre of the absurd**. With this expression we refer to a group of dramatist who wrote between the 1950s and 1960s, and the main feature of these dramatist is that they gave expression to feelings of loss, meaninglessness, confusion; they gave expression to that sense of nullity and absurdity.

The atomic bomb on Iroshima and Nagasaki, as well as the nazi death-camps had shocked the whole world, to the point that a german theorist, Adorno, said that art was no longer possible after Aushwitz.
Samuel Beckett answered with his literary production and with his theatre of absurd, challenging Adorndo point of view.

Samuel Beckett is considered the main representative of the theatre of the absurd, with his plays he confronted men with this absence of meanings, which emerges after WWII.
He presented man trapped in everyday living, with the need of finding meanings and purposes from the past which however are no longer valid for the present. He portrayed this sense of nullity, this idea of non existance, of meaninglessness, and he express this nostalgia for past meanings which were no longer usefull after what had happened.

## *Waiting fot Godot*

This play is subtitled "a tragicomedy in two acts".
This play has both comic and tragic elements, there are some ironic connotation, as well as some terrifing implication. It is divided into two acts, but both are very similar, because there is no real plot. What happens in the first act, happens also in the second one, with some differences.

The first words of this play are "nothing to be done", and in fact it happens nothing in this play.
We find two characters, **Vladimir** and **Estragon**, they two tramps, they stand by a tree in a road, and they talk with each other while they wait for a misterious figure, Mr. Godot. They fill time with their meaningless discussion, they play absurd wordgames.
While they are waiting two others characters appear, Pozzo and Lucky.
At the end of the first act, an unnamed boy appears on stage, saying that Godot's arrival is postponed, because he will arrive the next day.
Thi is exactly what happened also in the second act, with the difference that Pozzo and this unnamed boy do not remember about the previous day.

In this play there is no action, it's the situation that take precedence over action. Samuel Beckett wanted to show the absence of purposes and meaning in life.
The structure is almost simmetrical, circular because there is no beginning and there is no end. The audience had the impression that this repetition will continue to go on endlessly.

In this play we find five characters: Vladimr and Estragon, Pozzo and Lucky and this unnamed boy. Four of these five character can be grouped in complementary couples:

- Vladimir and Estragon are mutually dependend, one cannot exist without the other; they do not have the same personality, they are complementary: Vladimir is the most practical, rational and intellectual, whereas Estragon is more childish, and he tends to fall asleep and to dream, while Vladimir is speaking: they are mutually dependent.
- Lucky and Pozzo: Pozzo is the master, and Lucky is the slave: When they appear on stage, Pozzo is drawing Lucky with a rope, so they are mutually dependend in the same way Vladimir and Estragon are. 

Pozzo cannot remember anything about the previous day, whereas Lucky can, and so we can make an other distinction among these characters:

- Vladimir and Lucky, as they stand for the intellect
- Estragon and Pozzo, as they stand for the body

In this play Beckett was also able to show the duality between mind and body.

We don't know much about the unnamed boy and about the others characters: in this play there is little plot and also little charactarization.

There is also Godot, who never appears: the tramps perceive that Godot might give meaning to their life, but they also fear him.
Critics have discussed about the real identity of Godot: Beckett said that not even him knew who Godot was. Critics said that Godot might represents God. 

Actually this play ends with the words
> Let's Go.

Even if we don't see Godot in stage, ironically in the end of the stage it appears, since "go." is the same as "go dot". 
Godot can also be paralled with the idea of ending, if he had appeared on the stage the play would have found its end, but this play is centered on repetition.

In spite of the reiterated theme of nonexistance, the characters actually go on existing; it seems that they are trapped on stage, they would like to leave the stage but they are compelled to stay.
They are compelled to stay because of the existance of the play itself, which is to be performed. 

For Becket not only life and society are absurd, but we also see how art becomes part of the tirany of existance: art like life is an act of creation and continuance, but art can no longer provide us with meanings capable of filling our interior void; art is no longer capable of providing us a solution for our sense of misery.
His position is different from that of Joyce and Eliot, who saw art as a pseudo-religion form of salvation.

### Themes

The most important theme is the **theme of waiting**: all the play revolves around this continuosly postponed meeting with mister Godot: this is the first theme: the individual trapped in a constant process of waiting.

**Inability to act** through the representation of action without progression: there is no action, no progression, its the situation that rules the play.

**Incomunicability** between human beings: Vladimir and Estragon go on talking, but they talk about nothing: they aren't really communicating.

**Sterility of the world**: this is evident from the sterile connotation of their dialogues, but also this is an aspect that we can infer from the absence of women and also from the setting, which is minimalistic (there is only a solitary tree)

**Characters' lack of memory**

### T: *Waiting*

This extract is taken from the end of the play, from the second act. 

The setting is always the same, these two tramps stand by the side of a road, next to this solitary tree, the setting is minimalistic as the plot is, but there is no real sense of place: it could be any road or any tree.

An unnamed boy appears, bringing the news that Mr. Godot won't come that evening, maybe he will come the following name; this boy delivers the message to Vladimir; Estragon is actually sleeping.
Some traits emerges and distinguish them, even though there is little characterization.

They decided not to go anywhere, and they decided to stay there in order to keep on waiting for Godot arrival. They consider the possibility of commiting suicide, but they abandon this idea since they do not have the physical instruments to kill themselves, they consider the possibility of using Estragon belt, which is too short and not strong enough.
There is an other reason that prevent them to taking their life again: death would signify a permanent separation between the two: they are mutually dependent, and they cannot part, they cannot separate: they both know that each one depends on the other, because it is the other that gives the sense that they exist. So there is a relationship of interdependence and also of affection apparently.

But this affection is only apparent: they keep talking to each other, but we have the idea that they are both immersed in their own universe, and they do not really try to communicate in what their universe consists

The language is simple, quit informal and essential. The dialogue is made up of a lot of ready made phrases, and it also made up of a lot of silences and pauses, which are meant to interupt the flow of conversation. There are a lot of repetition which are meant to reproduce the repetitiveness of life.
Words often have a double sense, a comic sense and a tragic sense. There is a peculiarity: this play is not only characterized by the combination of comic elements on the one hand and tragic elements on the other hand: this play is characterized by events and words that have both comic and tragic meaning simultanuosly.

The final message that we find in this play is that nothing can be done by contemporary men except for waiting. Becket is trying to make the audience feel and share this process of waiting, and then he want to make the audience experience the quality of inaction.

## Different types of theatre

It evidente that **Becket** moved away from the traditional features of drama.

**Oscar Wilde**'s plots are based on the idea of social climbing, while in **Shaw**'s plots there is always a social theme (the theatre was conceived as a tool to improve society). In **Becket** there is no plot.

**Wilde**'s setting is London High Society; **Shaw** uses London as a setting of his plays, but not only the upper classes; in **Becket** the setting is minimalistic and symbolic

The characters are outsiders for **Becket**, while in **Shaw** characters are mouthpeaces of the playwrights idea: he wanted to bring social issues to light, in order to improve society. In **Wilde** the characters are [stereotipati], since they are meant to entertain and satirize about the Victorian society.

**Wilde**'s aim was to entertain and satirize about the Victorian society without letting the audience thinking, **Shaw**'s aim was to improve society, he uses is theatre as a weapon and so he wasn't really appreciated since he attacked to harsh the society. **Beckett**'s aim was to highlight the lack of communication and the absence of meaning and purposes of contemporary society.
