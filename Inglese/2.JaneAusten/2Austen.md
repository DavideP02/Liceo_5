# Jane Austen

## Life

Jane Austen was born in 1775 in Steventon, Hampshire, in a small village in southern England where her father was rector of the church. The seventh of eight children, she spent her short, uneventful life within the circle of her very close, affectionate family. Her lifelong, inseparable companion was her sister Cassandra, who, like Jane, never married. She was educated at home by her father, and showed an interest in literature and writing very early. Her earliest writings in fact date from 1787. She then produced a large output of prose and, between 1975 and 1797, she completed _Elinor and Marianne_, which would become the basis of _Sense and Sensibility_, published in 1811, and _First Impressions_, which, later revised, became _Pride and Prejudice_, published in 1813. In 1798 she wrote _Northanger Abbey_, which was published posthumously. When her father died, Jane, her sister and mother settled at Chawton, a small country village a few miles from her birthplace. There Jane produced her most mature works: _Mansfield Park_, begun in 1811 and published in 1814; _Emma_, begun in 1814 and published in 1816; _Persuasion_, begun in 1815 and published in 1818, after her death. She died probably of Addison's disease in Winchester in 1817, and was buried in Winchester Cathedral. All her novels were published anonimously; her her identity was later revealed by her brother Henry who supervised the publication of _Northanger Abbey_ and _Persuasion_, adding a 'Biographica Notice of the Author'. Jane's fame, however, was already well estabilished: among her contemporaries, Sir Walter Scott was one of the first to realise her greatness in his review of _Emma_, where he pointed out her 'exquisite touch which renders ordinary common place things and characters'.

---
She is an unusual writer in the romantic period, because she wrote novels in a period when poetry was very popular. She wrote six novels.
Because of this and many other choices she made she is considered anti-romantic.

==Why is she anti-romantic?==

1. She wrote novels
2. She was no interested in historical events
3. She didn’t take part in literally circles
4. She didn’t care about social problems (as all romantics did)
5. She focuses on a class and a reality that she used to know very well: the **upper-middle class**. The world of her novels is restricted to provincial England. Critics had said that she lacked an overall vision of the historical and social events

==Why can we say she is a great writer?==

Because we still read her novels with great pleasure.
The strength of her novels appears in the following elements:

1. With her **penetrating inside** she recreates the triviality of **everyday life**. Made up of _dinners_, _dances_, _excursions_, _balls_, which she turns into opportunities to gather and study a large range of characters
2. **Characterisation**: she is very good at creating living characters from the kind of people she knew:
    - Landed gentry
    - Country clergy
    - Middle classes
 Her characters are reasonable creatures who are not given to violent inner conflicts, nor to fierce passions.
3. **Objectivity**: she seldom intrudes in her novels with comments or judgements. When she does so it’s generally in a delicate almost impersonal way, which makes her presence unobtrusive.
4. **Intensity of observation**: She is capable of observation but also of detachment, so she describes her characters with a scientific eye, neither sparing their faults, nor idealizing them.
5. **Profound psychological study**: her main subjects are _courtship_ and _marriage_. By dealing with them she shows the restrictions of the woman’s position in the 18th and 19th centuries, in which an unmarried woman was destined to the dull life of nursing elderly parents or relatives or looking after her relatives children.
6. **Lack of sentimentality**: feelings seem to be absent, or anyway well concealed under everyday rituals. At the core of everything there is marriage. Jane Austen doesn’t appreciate a marriage based on wealth or on a sudden violent passion. A good marriage is based on calm judgment and mutual understanding.
7. **Realism**: she never romances her stories, so she writes stories of domestic life, without heroes or adventures. She inherits the lesson Richardson’s novels, that are not so cheesy.
8. **Humor**: her sense of humor is subtle and unpredictable, and it is often made up of unexpected paradoxes.
9. **Satire**: She can be very mordant and witty, but she is never ruthless.
10. **Precise ad lucide style**, made up of
    - **dialogues** and conversations that are the main vehicle for the revelation of a character
    - **letter writing**, which is typical of the Augustian age, and rich in varied registers
    - **ironic wit**
    - **precise use of words**
    - **well structured** and **polished sentences**

## The novel of manners

The changes in the social hierarchy of English society in the 19th century provided the background for the rise of the novel of manners. Wealth and influence were passing from the aristocracy to the newly successful middle classes, so the standard markers for determining an individual’s position in society proved increasingly unreliable. The novel of manners dealt with how these classes behaved in everyday situations, and described their codes of conduct. The undisputed master of the novel of manners was Jane Austen, whose novels were based on the premise that there is a vital relationship between manners, social behaviour and character. They are usually set in the upper and middle levels of society, generally in the country with few insights into town life. They deal with the codes and conventions of daily behaviour through the description of visits, balls and teas as occasions for meeting. They explore personal relationships, class distinctions and deal with the influence of money and property on the way people treat each other. Their main themes are marriage and the complications of love and friendship. A third-person narrator is employed and dialogue plays a central role, especially as a vehicle for irony. Passions and emotions are not expressed directly but more subtly and obliquely.

## Marriage

Marriage is all important in Jane Austen’s novels. All her novels but for one deal with the theme of marriage.
Marriage was so important in this period because it granted a **social position** to women. If you didn’t marry your destiny would be looking after your relatives or looking after your relatives’ children, and it was quite frustrating.

According to Jane Austen ideal marriage is not based only on **physical attraction**, but on **mutual comprehension**, that should be reached after overcoming obstacles and clearing misunderstandings.
It took a long to a couple to **get together**.

The idea of marriage in _Pride and Prejudice_ is the one between Elizabeth and Darcy, while the one between Jane and Bingley, and especially between Elizabeth’s parents is far from perfect.

The traditional values of country families – such as property, decorum, money and marriage – provided the basis of the plots and settings of Jane Austen’s novels. They take place in England; there is no Scotland, Wales or Ireland and not even the industrial north of England. Jane Austen writes about the oldest England, based on the possession of land, parks and country houses; in her stories people from different counties get married as a result of the growing social mobility. The marriage market takes place in London, Bath and some seaside resorts where people used to gather and carry out their business. And it is in these places that all the troubles of Austen’s world occur: gossip, flirtations, seductions, adulteries. This happens because the marriage market has also produced a range of villains: unscrupulous relatives, seducers, gamblers and social climbers.

## Pride and Prejudice

### T: _Mr and Mrs Bennet_

- ==p. 317==

The wit that characterize Jane Austen is clear from the very first sentence.
The novel starts with a sort of epigram [frase ad effetto] which make we realize how clever the writer is.

> It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
>
> However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
>
> "My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
>
> Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
>
> "But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
>
> Mr. Bennet made no answer.
>
> "Do not you want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
>
> "You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
>
> This was invitation enough.
>
> "Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
>
> "What is his name?"
>
> "Bingley."
>
> "Is he married or single?"
>
> "Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
>
> "How so? how can it affect them?"
>
> "My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
>
> "Is that his design in settling here?"
>
> "Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
>
> "I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party."
>
> "My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
>
>"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
>
>"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
>
>"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
>
>"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new comers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
>
>"You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
>
>"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
>
>"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
>
>"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
>
>"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least."
>
>"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
>
>"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
>
>"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not visit them.""Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all."
>
>Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. Her mind was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.

It is the introduction to the novel, and it anticipates some remarkable features of the novel.

We get to know that the main worry of upper middle class family who have daughters is marriage: **marriage** is the most important theme of the novel, and it is closely connected to **love**, **status** and **wealth**.
Marriage will be presented in the novel from several point of view.

* The marriage between Elizabeth’s best friend Charlotte and Mr Collins is based on security
* Instead an other point of view is the **infatuation**, which is the marriage between Lydia and Mr Wickham
* The marriage between Mr Bingley and Elizabeth is better because it is based on. **physical attraction** and **real love**: this is the perfect marriage according to Jane Austen: it is based on mutual comprehension.
* Mr and Mrs Bennet are quite peculiar, since their marriage was based on physical attraction, but through the time beauty became withered, and now there is nothing, since they are too different:
	* Mr Bennet dislikes his wife, he despises her; he is much more clever than his wife, and he belongs to a superior family; he left his wife educate their 5 daughter , and he has isolated from the family (he is a sort of misanthrope). He looks down to his wife and daughter. He has given up in their education because his wife is uncontrollable, and he appreciates only one of his daughter, which is **Elizabeth**.
	* Mrs Bennet on the other hand is superficial, simple minded, ignorant and moody. He cares only about social occasions and gossip.
	* This is an example of how a marriage should never be from the very beginning: it’s a way to demonstrate Austen’s thesis.

### T: _Mr Darcy Proposes to Elizabeth_

- ==p. 319==

The passage signs the lowest moment in the relationship between Darcy and Elizabeth: so far they have acted kindly to each other, but now instead they are very aggressive to each other.

While Elizabeth is visiting her best friend, she is visited by Mr Darcy, who unexpectedly proposes to her.

The first part underline Mr Darcy’s agitation and upsets.

Abruptly he make his proposal.
The first words are wrong, since he says that it was a struggle to make that proposal. Elizabeth, who already feels like she has to defend herself,  weights his words.

Elizabeth reaction is beyond expression: she is **silent**.

He lists the reasons why he shouldn’t have proposed
> His sense of her inferiority — of its being a degradation — of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to  recommend his suit.

There are three stages of her reaction:

* She feels sorry, because she will refuse him
* After that she feels resentful
* And then she becomes angry.

She get angrier and angrier when she realizes that he is sure she will accept.
> He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security.

Elizabeth is very clever and dignified, but also very prejudiced: the anger she has so far experienced deprives her of the possibility of thinking clearly.

The reasons for her negation are:

#### First reason

> His sense of her inferiority -- of its being a degradation -- of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination

#### Second Reason

The way the proposal has been done

* Against will
* Against reason
* Against character

#### Third Reason

Mr Darcy has caused the separation between Jane and Bingley
> Had not my own feelings decided against you — had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?

Darcy reaction is unexpected, since she thinks he would be remorseful, but he isn’t.

#### Fourth Reason

Mr Wickham is a negative character. Before Mr Wickham father died, Darcy promised that he would help his son to start a career, and so he did. He get him a sum of money, but Wickham squandered this money on whores, drinking and gambling; then he became an army officer.
After he had squandered all his money he came back to Darcy to ask him more money, which he refuses. So Wickham eloped with Georgiana, Darcy’s sister who was then 13. Darcy had to go and get his sister back.
When Wickham meets Elizabeth tell her that Mr Darcy has appropriated his own money, and so Elizabeth believes in him.

In the end, Elizabeth believes that Darcy has deprived Wickham of his right inheritance.
> “And of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth with energy. “You have reduced him to his present state of poverty — comparative poverty. You have withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for him. You have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule.”

#### Fifth reason

When Elizabeth and Darcy first met, she overhears Darcy saying to Bingley that the only girl at the ball who could attract his attention is Jane, and that Elizabeth is tolerable. She is not beautiful enough to **tempt** him

Their first meeting so has been negative.

---

Mr Darcy at her negation became pale, and he feels very bad: he is **surprised**, **angry** and **upset**.

But Mr Darcy is strong, and doesn’t accept all his accusation. He accuses her to be pride. He is dignified.
> these offences might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.

Her reaction is even stronger: she says terrible phrases
> You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it.

Darcy feels **astonished**, **incredule** and **mortification**.
At the end he goes away.

After that he leaves, she cries for hours, because she realizes that she had refused the man she loved.

### The End

After a while she receive a letter from Mr Darcy, where he admits separating Jane and Bingley because he though that Jane was not in love with Mr Bingley. At the same time he reveals the truth about Wickham and his misbehavior.

Elizabeth starts reconsidering her attitude towards Wickham, Darcy and herself. The truth bursts out on her suddenly, and the change is permanent: she doesn’t have doubt about Darcy anymore.
When she experiences this **epiphany** many themes are concerned

1. **Pride**
2. **Vanity**
3. **Prejudice**
4. **Love**
5. **Reason**

Elizabeth balances good and bad qualities and she comes out changed after this long self reflection. She becomes aware that her good qualities became distorted and useless when they are influenced by vanity, mistrust and prejudice.
Now Elizabeth is humiliated, because she understands that she has made a mistake, but she is undergoing a process of self realization which makes her suffer, but which will make her a better person.

In the end the two characters will came together
