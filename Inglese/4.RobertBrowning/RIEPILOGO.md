# Robert Browning
## Life
He was born in 1820, and he died in 1889, in London.
He had a happy childhood, and his mother was very religious and a good musician.

It was his father who really educated him. He had little formal education, since he never attended school, and he only attended London University for short time.
He started writing poems when he was very young, still a boy, and he loved Italy, and he would spend all his youth and middle years in Italy.

The only memorable event of his life was his marriage with **Elizabeth Barrett**; she was 6 years older than him; they had to marry secretly because her father didn’t want her to marry him.
She died in 1861, and after he died he went back to England from Italy.

At the end of his life, he settled in Venice, and he died there.

After his death his corpse was claimed by England, and he was buried in **Poet’s corner** in _Westminster Abbey_.

## Dramatic monologue
He is outstanding because he created a new kind of poem, called **Dramatic Monologue**.

The Dramatic Monologue was not invented by Browning, but he actually inherited it from past writers, especially from _Shakespeare_; he wrote, especially in _Hamlet_ and _Macbeth_ long soliloquies, that are extended passages recited by one person; they are addressed to no-one in particular, but to the audience at large.
Through the soliloquy the character reveals his faults, his thoughts to the audience, while giving the impression that he is speaking to himself.

Browning chooses this poetic form because it gives him the possibility of **psychological exploration**; but he transformed the soliloquy into a **monologue** by means of the following devices:
1. he turned the soliloquy into a complete lyrical poem with a precise metrical structure;
2. he avoided any autobiographical reference, by introducing a third person, a speaker, who speaks about himself or about someone else;
3. he replaced the audience with one or more silent listeners, to whom the speaker addresses;
4. he called his monologues **dramatic**, in the sense of _theatrical_ (in fact they are dramas with characters) and _crucial_ (because the speaker is caught in a moment of crisis);
5. Browning preserves the **dramatic irony**, present in Elizabethan Soliloquies, since the speaker does not realize that what he is revealing to the listeners is excessive and dangerous;
6. he made his characters not only individuals not only individuals but stereotypes (symbols of a category or of an age);
7. he decided to use blank verse, which is _unrhymed iambic pentameter_, but the punctuation respected the line of thought, and this gave the impression of spoken language;
8. he set his monologues in a distant historical period, because he didn’t want to be involved.

## Poetry
He appreciated the arts and intelligent tourism, and he believed in progress: he was absolutely Victorian (optimistic).
He believed that everything offered to our experience, be it good or evil, is useful: evil is the necessary challenge for man to achieve good; in that way life becomes a battlefield, on which human beings must use all their energy, will and activity.

Browning started writing under Shelly’s influence, and he found his own style in the dramatic monologue, because he wanted to be objective and dramatic.

He wrote 3 types of dramatic monologues:
1. **Ironic self portraits** which continued the tradition of Chaucer’s _Canterbury Tales_; the irony which is used in these monologues is involuntary, because the protagonist doesn’t seem to realize that what he is saying will be imputed to him as guilt. _My Last Duchess_ belongs to this group.
2. In the second group Browning sets out to explore a **human problem**, and the monologue is usually a speech of defense made by the protagonist himself. _Frà Lippo Lippi_ and _Andrea del Sarto_ belongs to this group.
3. The last group are **love lyrics**; here the poet offers his tender invitations and his reflections to a woman; the themes are _love_, _music_, _religion_, _painting_.

Browning was a very prolific author; he wrote a lot of poems, plays and books, but most of his works are **obscure**,  and the most remarkable are his collection of poems, such as _Dramatic Lyrics_, and _Men and Women_.
In these _Dramatic Lyrics_ there is a subgroup titled _Madhouse Cells_, where he analyses the personality of mad people, the psychology of crazy people.
The two most famous poems are _My Last Duchess_ and _Porphyria’s Lover_.

## T: Porphyria’s Lovers
==p. 23 - V==

He talks about a murder: a man kills his lover because she is not ready to leave her husband and go with her lover.

It belongs to _Madhouse Cells_, because here Browning studies abnormal psychologies. The soliloquy consists in twelve five lines stanzas.

What makes P.L. particularly interesting is the detailed confession of the murderer, who obsessively reports every particular of the crime.

It can be divided into three parts

### Part 1
==**Line 1 to 5**==

> The rain set early in to-night,
>
> The sullen wind was soon awake,
>
> It tore the elm-tops down for spite,
>
> And did its worst to vex the lake:
>
> I listened with heart fit to break.
>
It’s a sort of prologue, with the description of the time of the day (late afternoon, merging into night) and the weather conditions, which are bad: it’s raining hard, and the wind is tearing the elm-tops.; the wind is also rising little waves on the lake.

The **gloomy weather** mirrors the psychological lability of the speaker, who listens to the noises of the external storm with a similar tempest in his heart.

The lover is in the cottage, waiting for Porphyria, the woman he passionately love, but of whose love is not sure.

### Part 2
==**Line 6 to 30**==

> When glided in Porphyria; straight
>
> She shut the cold out and the storm,
>
> And kneeled and made the cheerless grate
>
> Blaze up, and all the cottage warm;
>
> Which done, she rose, and from her form
>
> Withdrew the dripping cloak and shawl,
>
> And laid her soiled gloves by, untied
>
> Her hat and let the damp hair fall,
>
> And, last, she sat down by my side
>
> And called me. When no voice replied,
>
> She put my arm about her waist,
>
> And made her smooth white shoulder bare,
>
> And all her yellow hair displaced,
>
> And, stooping, made my cheek lie there,
>
> And spread, o’er all, her yellow hair,
>
> Murmuring how she loved me — she
>
> Too weak, for all her heart’s endeavour,
>
> To set its struggling passion free
>
> From pride, and vainer ties dissever,
>
> And give herself to me for ever.
>
> But passion sometimes would prevail,
>
> Nor could to-night’s gay feast restrain
>
> A sudden thought of one so pale
>
> For love of her, and all in vain:
>
> So, she was come through wind and rain.

We see the lady who arrives at the cottage, she glide in;
she is a lady, she is aristocratic, she is very rich, and her lover instead is of a lower class; even through she is a lady, she kneels in front of the fireplace, and she pokes the fire, which is dying out.

She takes off her wet cloak, her shawl and her gloves, and she let her damp hair fall.

She calls her lover, but he doesn’t reply, because he is angry and aggressive. She coaxes him, and she murmurs she loves him.

_Why is he so angry?_
Because he knows she is too proud and too weak to exchange the glittering world she belongs to for a humble life with him forever. In this moment her passion prevails, and she is happy and belongs to him.

### Part 3
==**Line 31-60**==

> Be sure I looked up at her eyes
>
> Happy and proud; at last I knew
>
> Porphyria worshipped me; surprise
>
> Made my heart swell, and still it grew
>
> While I debated what to do.
>
> That moment she was mine, mine, fair,
>
> Perfectly pure and good: I found
>
> A thing to do, and all her hair
>
> In one long yellow string I wound
>
> Three times her little throat around,
>
> And strangled her. ==No pain felt she==;
>
> I am quite sure she felt no pain.
>
> As a shut bud that holds a bee,
>
> I warily oped her lids: again
>
> Laughed the blue eyes without a stain.
>
> And I untightened next the tress
>
> About her neck; her cheek once more
>
> Blushed bright beneath my burning kiss:
>
> I propped her head up as before,
>
> Only, this time my shoulder bore
>
> Her head, which droops upon it still:
>
> The smiling rosy little head,
>
> So glad it has its utmost will,
>
> That all it scorned at once is fled,
>
> And I, its love, am gained instead!
>
> Porphyria’s love: she guessed not how
>
> Her darling one wish would be heard.
>
> And thus we sit together now,
>
> And all night long we have not stirred,
>
> And yet God has not said a word!

Here the crime occurs, and it is devoted to the lover, and to his joyful surprise when he realizes that Porphyria does love him.

_What can he do to detain this perfect moment?_
The answer of his deranged mind is that in order not to loose his possession **he must kill her**; by killing her she will be his forever.
He winds her hair around her slender neck three times and strangles her.

But madness is evident when he says “no pain felt she”, that reminds us of Othello’s words: “I would have thee linger in thy pain”.

When a person murders another person, especially in this condition, he thinks he is similar to God, because he has the power of life and death; Othello’s mind is deranged by jealousy, Lover’s one by madness: they both assume they are similar to God because they think they have a right to allot [assegnare, distribuire] death.

Now Porphyria is dead, she is in his arms, he opens her lids, he loosens her hair, and he kisses her repeatedly. He sicks all night long, without stirring, with her corps in his arms; the conclusion he draws is that **as God has said nothing, he has made a good action**.

Browning closes the poem with the line whose meaning is obscure. _Does he mean that madness is beyond God’s judgement?_ _Who can condemn a man who doesn’t know the boundaries between good and evil?_

After murdering the woman, the speaker feels he has complete power on her. The speaker is mentally alienated, he is cool and murderous, pitiless. It is a case of lucid insanity; the tone is cold and reflective.

## T: My Last Duchess
The poem is settled in Ferrara, when Alfonso II d’Este was the duke. It is set in the period of Italian Renaissance.

The speaker is the duke himself, but the real protagonist is her late wife; the silent listener is the ambassador of the Count of Tyrol.
_Why is he there?_ He has to define together with the duke the amount of the dowry that the Count of Tyrol’s daughter, who is promised to the Duke.

The Duke has had his previous wife killed, because she didn’t behave as well as he expected. Now he is going to marry an other lady, the Count of Tyrol’s Daughter, and he is defining the dowry that she will have to give him in order to became a duchess, since countess is lower than duchess.

The Duke is taking the Ambassador through his castle, to visit it, because he wants to impress him, in order to get a larger dowry: they are in front of a Canvas, which represents the Duchess, in all her youth and beauty.
There is this painting, hanging on a wall, representing the duchess. The Duke attitude while describing the paining is detached, cold, indifferent.

On _line 16_, in order to make the situation more realistic, the Duke quotes an imaginary monastic painter, in order to make the painting more precious in his listener’s eyes. The painter looks like the prototype of the Renaissance artist, working at the service of a patron.

The poem start abruptly, and there are colloquial elements: similar to an everyday speech.

>	_FERRARA_
>
>
>
> That’s my last Duchess painted on the wall,
>
> Looking as if she were alive. I call
>
> That piece a wonder, now; Fra Pandolf’s hands
>
> Worked busily a day, and there she stands.
>
> Will’t please you sit and look at her? I said
>
> “Fra Pandolf” by design, for never read
>
> Strangers like you that pictured countenance,
>
> The depth and passion of its earnest glance,
>
> But to myself they turned (since none puts by
>
> The curtain I have drawn for you, but I)
>
> And seemed as they would ask me, if they durst,
>
> How such a glance came there; so, not the first
>
> Are you to turn and ask thus. Sir, ’twas not
>
> Her husband’s presence only, called that spot
>
> Of joy into the Duchess’ cheek; perhaps
>
> Fra Pandolf chanced to say, “Her mantle laps
>
> Over my lady’s wrist too much,” or “Paint
>
> Must never hope to reproduce the faint
>
> Half-flush that dies along her throat.” Such stuff
>
> Was courtesy, she thought, and cause enough
>
> For calling up that spot of joy. She had
>
> A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad,
>
> Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er
>
> She looked on, and her looks went everywhere.
>
> Sir, ’twas all one! My favour at her breast,
>
> The dropping of the daylight in the West,
>
> The bough of cherries some officious fool
>
> Broke in the orchard for her, the white mule
>
> She rode with round the terrace—all and each
>
> Would draw from her alike the approving speech,
>
> Or blush, at least. She thanked men—good! but thanked
>
> Somehow—I know not how—as if she ranked
>
> My gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name
>
> With anybody’s gift. Who’d stoop to blame
>
> This sort of trifling? Even had you skill
>
> In speech—which I have not—to make your will
>
> Quite clear to such an one, and say, “Just this
>
> Or that in you disgusts me; here you miss,
>
> Or there exceed the mark”—and if she let
>
> Herself be lessoned so, nor plainly set
>
> Her wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse—
>
> E’en then would be some stooping; and I choose
>
> Never to stoop. Oh, sir, she smiled, no doubt,
>
> Whene’er I passed her; but who passed without
>
> Much the same smile? This grew; I gave commands;
>
> Then all smiles stopped together. There she stands
>
> As if alive. Will’t please you rise? We’ll meet
>
> The company below, then. I repeat,
>
> The Count your master’s known munificence
>
> Is ample warrant that no just pretense
>
> Of mine for dowry will be disallowed;
>
> Though his fair daughter’s self, as I avowed
>
> At starting, is my object. Nay, we’ll go
>
> Together down, sir. Notice Neptune, though,
>
> Taming a sea-horse, thought a rarity,
>
> Which Claus of Innsbruck cast in bronze for me!

This Duke is quite unusual.
The Duke is aware that Fra Pandolf’s works are motivated by flattery, and the Duke attitude toward flattery is sneering; but Fra Pandolf is also a pretest for the duke to introduce the duchess. In fact al the central part of the poem talks about her,

She ranked everything on the same level.

The Duke strongly disapproves on her behavior, but in spite of his disapproving words the Duke unconsciously reveals the duchess’s genuine outstanding  traits: she is good; in fact she was
* young
* naive
* full of life
* generous
* smiling
* wellcoming
* democratic, in the sense that she considerate all people on the same level
* openhearted and
*  warm,
* spontaneous
* delicate
* extrovert
* delightful

On the other hand the dukes opinion on her is that she was frivolous, superficial, gullible (too ready to believe); she was unaware of the honor imparted to her

The image that comes out is the one of a very young girl married to a much older man, which was a situation not so infrequent in renaissance courts.

At _line 34 to 43_ the attention is shifted from the Duchess to the Duke, who reveals his proud temper, by refusing to stoop

The poem now comes to his climx, on line 45-46, when he says “I gave commands; Then all smiles stopped together”; the duchess finally leaves the scene and disappear;
the Duke in fact dismiss her in a a few more word: “There she stands As if alive.” which repeats the line at the beginning: this enclose the tragic event in an imaginary framework.

The duchess has been killed, because her husband disliked her, but the way the duke produces this piece of information is indifferent, laconic, dry, cynical, casual and cold.

If the poem ended here, it would simply sound like the skillful narration of a dramatic episode, but it would be incomplete and unconvincing. It is in fact only the last 10 lines that provide a series of shocking revelations, essential to the understanding of the poem

We get to know that “the count your master” is the Count of Tyrol, “the company below” is a group of friends, so we infer the identity of the auditor, that is the ambassador of the Count of Tyrol, and the reasons for the marriage, that are the countess of Tyrol needs to improve in the social ladder, and the duke wants a new wife and money.

We also can infer the reason why the Duke told the auditor the tragic story of his last duchess; the reason is to warn the Countess of Tyrol not to behave as his former wife.

Considering that the poem is set in Renaissance Ferrara, and that it is possibly based on a real historical event, the Duke **might** be Alfonso d’Este, who had his first wife Lucrece to be killed after only three years of marriage.

After defining the personality of the duchess, we are able to point out the duke’s positive and negative connotations.

**Positive**:
* lover of the art, he loves beautiful things
* he is aristocratic
* he is a patron of the artist
* he’s a refined speaker

**Negative**:
* he is cruel
* possessive
* cynical
* ready to kill
* greedy (avid for power and money)
* self centered
* amoral
* feels entitled to allot death on his properties, which is something that only god is allowed to
* the duke’s true love is himself, and he considers his wife as a rightful pieces of property
