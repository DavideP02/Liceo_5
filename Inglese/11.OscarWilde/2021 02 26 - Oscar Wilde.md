# 26 feb 2021 — Oscar Wilde
His tour was a success, and when he came back he got married and he had two children.

In 1891 he published his first and only novel *The picture of Dorian Gray*; Wilde wasn’t appreciated as a novelist, and his novel was considered immoral, mainly for his insistence on hedonism, but also for his common sexual connotations.

Anyway Wilde managed to increase his literary prestige by turning to the theatre. He reached the climax of his success with his witty comedies. In the years 1892-1895. During those years his comedies were performed at the same time on different stages in London.
His masterpiece in theatre is *The Importance of Being Ernest*, published in 1895.

When he was at the height of his career his reputation rapidly declined, because he was accused of homosexuality by his lover’s father. The accusation proved correct; he was sentenced to two years of hard labour.
He was in prison from 1895 to 1897, and while he was in prison he wrote a poem: *The Ballad of Reading Gaol*, and it was his last published (in 1898) work during his life.

This poem deals with death penalty, because it is about the hanging of a man, for the brutal murder of his wife: Wilde discuss on themes such as injustice, betrayal and the need for forgiveness. The idea he developed is that the greater the crime, the more charity is needed.

While he was in prison he also wrote a long and touching letter to his beloved, entitled *De Profundis*; it was published after Wilde death, in 1905.
When he was released, he was a broken man, and he could bear the scandal of his situation, his wife obviously refused him, so he went into exile in France, where he lived the last years of his life, in poverty and under and under an assumed name.

He died in 1900 of meningitis, and he was buried in Paris in the same cimitero of Baudelaire, who strongly influenced Wilde’s life and art.

In his life Wilde embodied the figure of the rebel and of the dandy.
He was a **rebel** for his rebellious attitude towards those false conventions and Prejudices of Victorian Society, which, according to him, represented a form of restraint, on the process of artistic creation
He was also a **dandy** since he paid a lot of attention to his outward appearance, and he was an eccentric and extravagant person, with a strong sense of elegance and sophistication.

## *The Picture of Dorian Gray*
### The Preface
* ==p. 127==

This text is really important. He published this novel in 1891 in its final edition. He had previously published it, but it was not appreciated by the literary society, so he decided to include this preface, which had yet been published as an essay for a magazine.
This text is really important since it is considered as the English Manifesto of aestheticism, because it picks out the subject of art and the figure of the artist.
