In this case the painter doesn't agree with him, since he doesn't want to show the portrait, since he finds that he has put too much of himself in it.

Basil doesn't want to disclose the identity of the man who is portrayed, because he is afraid that this portrait might reveal his secret artistic idolatry for Dorian Gray.
This idolatry doesn't seem to be purely professional. It also has personal implications (homosexual connotation)

## Dorian Death
* ==p. 121==

This extract is from the end of the novel. It begins with a positive note: it is a lovely warm evening, and Dorian Gray is walking home, in a leasurly way: than he starts thinking about his bad behaviour, and at this point of the novel, Dorian would like to clean his conscience.

In order to do so, he decides that he won't never tempt innocence again: there is a girl who has fallen in love with him, and he tries to convince her that he is a wicked man. This girl refuses to believe him, because he's not old and ugly, as all wicked people were, according to her.

Dorian Gray wants to change, and so he decides not to tempt this girl. He hopes that some improvements might appear on the portrait.
1. He blames his own pride and passion for this situation.
2. He blames the fact that he has received no punishment to purify him.
3. Finally he blames his own beauty and youth

When analyzing his situation, Dorian doesn't consider himself guilty for the death of Basil Hallward and Alan Campbell.
At a certain point of the novel Basil decides to confront Dorian, because terrible things are been said about him. Rumors say that he has a bad and destructive influence on people, that Basil refuses to believe that this rumors are true: he asks Dorian to show him is real soul. Dorian shows him his portrait, because he feels that the portrait is the reflection of his soul.
Then Dorian is forced to kill Basil, in order to prevent him from telling other people how his portrait has become.

He considers that the murder of Basil is just a moment of madness.

Alan Campbell was a talented Chemist, and Dorian blackmails him because he wants to use his skills as chemist to get rid of Basil's body.
Alan accomplish this task unhappily, and then he committed suicide. Since he committed suicide, Dorian doesn't feel responsible for Alan own actions.

He decides he won't tempt innocence, which is the only good thing he did. He look at picture and sees no improvement in the picture.
The reasons of this is that apparently good act is actually a pure act of vanity, and it might be an other expression of his desire to investigate all possibilities offered by life. Dorian feel entitled to experience everything that life could offer to him: he becomes more and more involved in sophisticated adventures, but also in bad experiences.
This decision not to tempt innocence might also be a consequence of his passion to act apart.

When he looks at the portrait, he sees no sign of improvement, his reaction is not of remorse, but of pain and indignation.
