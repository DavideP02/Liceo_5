# 5 mar 2021 - Dorian Gray

## T: _Dorian's Death_
* ==p. 131==

For a moment he considers the possibility of confessing his crimes, but then he immediately rejects this idea, because he thinks that nobody will believe him, since he has been so careful of getting rid of evidence.

Before reaching the decision to destroy the portrait, his mind goes through a series of steps.
* __line 15-16__: nostalgia for his pure boyhood
* __line 16-20__: awareness of his corruption
* __line 21-23__: Dorian recollects his pact to keep eternal youth
* __line 23-25__: his wish for repentance and purification
* __line 34-38__: he reaches the awareness that beauty and youth have caused his ruin
* __line 39-40__: Dorian expresses his wish to free himself from the past (which is also evidente in **line 50**)
* **line 50-56**: Dorian doubts about his salvation
* **line 62-76**: Dorian understands that repentance was just a pure illusion
* **line 96-99**: Dorian finally comes to the decision to destroy the picture: he stabs the portrait, but in doing so he also kills himself, because the portrait is the reflection of his own soul. In fact one of the main themes of the novel (along with beauty and art) is also **duplicity**

==**Duplicity**==: This story is a novel about a split identity; we can read this novel as an allegorical representation of the legend of Faust (by Marlow): he was a man who sells his soul to the Devil in order to all his desires satisfied. There are some differences:
1. Dorian makes a pact with an absent devil
2. Dorian gets eternal beauty and youth

In the end Dorian dies, and the portrait recovers all its past perfection: in this novel it is art that wins in the end.
Dorian turns into a disgusting old man, and when the servants find his body, they are able to recognize him only by his rings.

Wilde's intention was not to write a moral novel, even if the main character actually seems to be punished in the end. For Oscar Wilde art shouldn't deal with morality: the artist may consider the moral and immoral life of people as materials for his art, but there is no judgment. Art is not supposed to teach anything: those who try to go beneath the surface of a work, do so at their own risk.

## Victorian Drama
* ==p. 31==

Very little drama or not was produced in the Victorian period: the decline in the production of dramatic words is caused by:
1. predominance of the novel
2. the power acquired by the theatrical managers, who preferred to stage well known traditional plays, rather than try out new ones; many companies mainly performed Shakespeare, although with many of the text cut or even changed, in order to better suit the victorian tastes
3. many victorians did not appreciate drama as a form of art, since they still consider actor and actresses as people of little respectability and doubtful morality

There is one great innovation, related to the Victorian playhouse: the new theaters became smaller but more pretentious; they could be afforded only by the well off.

The typical features of the Victorian playhouse:
* semicircular
* lighted by gas light and later on by electricity, while the audience was left in darkness
* the stage was separated from the audience by a curtain, and this allowed the scenery to be changed

The new playhouses tended towards a more realistic staging, which made more use of actions and movement, and of setting. The keyword was to **reach the illusion of reality**.
The stage directions became longer and much more detailed.

On the one hand, through the use of this theatrical machinery, the staging was more spectacular but on the other hand there were also some negative consequences:
* this type of staging was more expensive: for the theatrical manager it became unprofitable to stage different plays during the same theatrical season
* the victorian age was a period of great performers, so actors and actresses demanded a higher salary for their job.

This finally leads to a lost of flexibility, who brought managers to stage traditions well know tragedies instead of new ones.
