## The Preface
* ==p. 127==

This preface is important since it is considered the English manifest of Aestheticism. He explains his a philosophy of Art for Art’s sake.

The word art and artist are repeated 11 times each, while the adjective beautiful is repeated 6 times.

This preface is a list of aphorisms, which is a clever saying expressing a truth; the style is epigrammatic, since these general truths are expressed in a short and amusing way, and the language is abstract and witty.

## The picture of Dorian Gray

The protagonist of this novel is Dorian Gray: he is a handsome young man, whose beauty fascinates the painter Basil Hallward. This painter is so fascinated by Dorian’s beauty that he decides to fix his beauty forever in a portrait.

When Dorian sees his portrait he becomes aware of his beauty, because until this moment he wasn’t fully aware of its own beauty.

Another key character is Lord Henry Watson, who is a cynical aristocrat, he is an aesthete, who believes in nothing but beauty and youth. He initiates Dorian into the cult of Aestheticism.

Dorian is so enchanted by his beauty that he makes a wish: he wishes that his beauty and his youth can remain forever intact while the portrait ages in his place. By some strange magic this is exactly what happens. With the passing of time, while Dorian’s beauty and youth are preserved intact, the portrait starts to show not only his marks of age, but also the marks and the signs of the immoral life that Dorian is living under the influence of Lord Henry Watson.

In the novel Lord Henry Watson provides Dorian with an unnamed book, that was probably *A rebour*, written by the Belgian writer Huysmans in 1887; it describes the strange sensual experiences of its protagonist, Des Esseintes, who becomes the stereotype of the aesthete of _fin de siecle_ literature.

Under the influence of Lord Henry Watson, Dorian Gray embarks on a life of vice and sensual reputation: he becomes more and more involved in ambiguous adventures and he also provokes the suicide of Sybil Vane, the girl who passionately love him.

Then Dorian becomes aware of the immorality of his actions, and he realises that the only way to put an end to his bad behaviour is destroying the portrait, which he feels responsible for his actions. By stabbing the portrait he also kills himself (and this is the end of the novel).

The character of Dorian Gray embodies a typical Dandy, and so we can trace a parallelism between this characters and two others literary figures: Andrea Sperelli (from *Il piacere*) and Des Esseint (from *A rebour*). They are three dandies who live their life looking for beauty and elegance. Their immoral experiences are described by these authors using a refined language.

### The Painter’s Studio
* ==p. 129==

This extract is from the first novel chapter. The narrator is a third person narrator, who is unobstrusive, since he never interveins in the narration, and he never addresses the readers directly . This extracts introduces two of the main characters of the novel: one is Basile Hallward, who is the painter and an intellectual who tends to isolate himself from the rest of the world; the other is Lord Henry Watson, who is a brilliant talker, his way of speaking is humorous and satirical: he is only apparently superficial, and in fact in the novel he is able to develop a strong criticism for some Victorian institutions, such as marriage, religion and morality.

The characters are introduced by what they say or what they do, or by what other people say about them, and not by the narrator.
The technic adopted by Wilde is more typical of drama.

This abstract can be divided into three section
