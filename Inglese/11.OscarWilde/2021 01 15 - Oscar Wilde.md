# 15 gen 2021 - Oscard Wilde

## Life

He was ==born in Dublin==, and he was quite well off, because his father was an eye and ear surgeon. His mother was an eccentric woman. She expected Oscar to be a female, so she used to dress him in girl's clothes.

He is educated at Trinity College and here he reveals his ==unconventional personality==, since unlike his fellow students he hates sports and games, he loaths drinking and whoring and he likes fishing and solitude. He was not very popular, both with his teacher, who thought he was lazy, and with his fellow students, because he dislikes their coarse humor and their virile actions.

He reads a lot, and he eventually wins a gold medal for Greek. Thanks to this medal, he wins a scholarship at ==Oxford University==. Here he spends happy years soon establishing a reputation as a brilliant talker, an anti conformist and a wonderful entertainer.

While he was at Oxford he met two intellectual: ==John Ruskin and Walter Pater==. They both influence his life very deeply. **Ruskin** attracted him by his socialist ideals, and **Pater** taught him a new conception of art, devoid of any moral responsibility.

When he finish university he inherited money from his father, and so he settled in ==London==. Here he attracted attention to himself wearing eccentric clothes. He was occasionally seen with a sunflower in his hand, or with exotic flowers in his button hole.

## Art for Art's sake
* ==p. 125==

The concept of Art for Art's Sake' was not merely an aesthetic one. Wilde believed that only art as the cult of beauty could prevent the murder of the soul. He perceived the artist as an alien in a materialistic world, he wrote only to please himself and was not concerned about communicating his theories to his fellow-beings. His pursuit of beauty and fulfilment was the tragic act of a superior being inevitably rejected as an outcast.

## The rebel and dandy
* ==p. 125==

Wilde adopted the 'aesthetic ideal', as he affirmed in one of his famous conversations:
> My life is like a work of art!

He lived the double role of rebel and dandy. Wilde's dandy is an aristocrat whose elegance is a symbol of the superiority of his spirit; he uses his wit to shock and he is an individualist who demands absolute freedom. Since life was meant for pleasure, and pleasure was an indulgence in the beautiful, Wilde's interest in beauty - clothes, words or physical beauty â€“ had no moral stance. In the _Preface_ to his novel he affirmed:

> There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all?

In this way he rejected the didacticism that had characterised the Victorian novel in the first half of the century.
