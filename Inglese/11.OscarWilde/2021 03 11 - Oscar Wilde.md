## The importance of Being Ernest

In _The importance of Being Earnest_ sentimentalism and melodrama are replaced by frivolous situations. The characters are sketched, the language is sparkling and it is rich in paradoxes and nonsense. No moral judgment ever intrudes, we only have a gentle satire on the Victorian upper classes.

The main and secondary plots interweave in perfect unity and the characters are vividly sketched.
The language is sparkling and rich in witticism, epigrams, paradoxes and nonsense.

Considering the title of the comedy, it contains a pun. Earnest means honest, but it is pronounced as the proper name Ernest.

The 4 characters are all well-off and members of aristocracy;
- Gwendolen is resolute and helpful
- Cecily is hurt and surprised
- Jack is hesitant, nervous and indifferent with Algernon
- Algernon is disconcerted and detached; indifferent to external problems, he is frivolous and superficial

The two girls join forces against the two men. The two pairs react to the discussion of serious problems by doing trivial things

The serious problems are:
- identity
- marriage
- social status
- property
- baptism

The stage directions provide comments on the characters’ reactions. The wish of the two men of being baptized may be the symbol of their turning their backs on their old life and facing their new-married-life in an appropriate state of earnestness.

### Plot

All the characters present themselves as polite and sincere but actually they are manipulative
and calculating. This comedy is centred on two main characters, Jack Worthing and Algernon Moncrief, they
both live double lives. Jack lives in the country but he often go to London to visit his fictitious brother Ernest. Algernon lives in London but he often goes to the country to visita fictitious old friend, the
Bunbury.

On one of his visits to London, Jack falls in love with a giri, Gwendolen. Algernon during a visit in the country, falls in love with Cecily, Jack's ward (a person who is looked after a person which his not her parent) and she thinks that Algernon is actually Jack's
brother Ernest. At a certain point of the story both Gwendolen and Cecily believe they are engaged to Ernest, there are many comic complications but in the end it transpires that Jack as a baby was left in a handbag in the station, Algernon is his brother and also Jack's name is indeed Ernest. In the end he can assume his name Ernest and he becomes earnest.
The two couples are reconciled and they can finally start a new life in a state of earnestness.
This comedy can be read in different levels:
- As a farse which plays on mistaken identities and misunderstandings
- Parody of romantic love, it mocks the idea of love at first sight, the two women seem to be
more in love with the name Ernest rather than with the boy they are in love with. The structure
of social relations is reduced to a question of names.
- At a deeper level this comedy is a social satire on the Victorian moral values placed on
appearances, apparently the comedy is a hard less amusing work but at a deeper level Wilde
actually dealt with serious themes such as identity, marriage, social status, property and
baptism. In the end the two men want to be baptised as Ernest, they want to turn their back
on their old lives and they want to start a new life.

### T: The Interview
- ==p. 137==

Gwendolen's mother is testing him trough a series of persona! questions to test Jack. The first part deals with Lady Bracknell's most important topics, smoking and money, the second section deals with Lady Bracknell's least important topic, family.

- In yellow we have the topics of conversation, they talk about education, age, smoking, incarne, possession and family,
- in pink we have the social cliches connected to the fact that the characters belong to the upper classes
- green dots refers to the woman's point of view on Jack's origins,
- words underlined in blue contains Lady Bracknell's remarks which reveals that she is bossy and frivolous and arrogant;
- light blue contains the paradoxes used by Lady Bracknell,
- in green we have Jack's concern for upper class' values,
- the red dots refers to what Jack has to do if he wants to marry Gwendolen.

On **Line 39/40** we have a comic effect which is createci by the confusion of the common meaning of the verb "to lose" and its idiomatic sense in the expression of "to lose one's parents" (orphan).

The language is sophisticated and artificial, perfect for the characters of the upper classes.
Marriage as a tool to achieve social status.

#### Most important themes:
- the institution of marriage
- criticism about Victorian prudery and exaggerated seriousness, hypocrisy and absurdity
- appearance is another important feature of the play

---

Wilde’s two main targets of this play are social hipocrisy and the mercenary marriage market of the high societyof his age. His satire is good-humoured, the plot makes fun of the conventions of the day, the education, the relations between romantic love and the simplicity of the country.
