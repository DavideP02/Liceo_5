## Victorian Drama
* ==p. 31==

The **audience** at the time went to the theatre just to be amused, and not to meditate on problems.The type of theatre that the victorians demanded was farce spectacol and above all Melodrama.

This latter kind of theatre, **melodrama** was probably the most appreciated: they are highly schematic plays with stereotypical characters, absurd plots. The common features of all melodrama, is that good must triumph over evil. The victorian appreciated the morality on which melodrama was based, because the spectator could easily identify themself with the hero.
For certain aspects we can say that melodrama returned to the morality plays of the Middle Ages.

There is a more innovating and subversive type of theatre that was emerging at the time, of the form of **music hall**. They are a type of theatrical entertainment, characterized by a mixture of comedy and popular song. Music hall was considered a low form of theatre, also because it dealt with taboo subjects, such as sex. It dealt with these taboo subjects using the tecnique of the _double meaning_.
It was mainly appreciated by the working classes, and even though it was considered a low form of theatre, it was to be of great influence in the 20th century, both on early cinema, especially in the films of _Charlie Chaplin_, and on the work of Samuel Beckett.

After this period of stagnation, in which we have almost a gap in the production of new plays worth of note, with the last quarter of the 19th century, British Drama begins to show the first signs of revival. In fact the 1890s marked a reinessance in English dramatic art.

This period of renaissance in theatre wasn't limited to the British context. Drama was changing and improving all of the Europe, and we can now outline the influences coming from abroad, which had an impact on British drama.

### Chekhov

He was Russian. He replaced the lack of action with a constant inquiring into the psychology of his characters

### Strindberg
He is a Swedish playwright who mixed naturalism with psychology, providing a deeper insight into life, together with penetrating studies of women.

### Ibsen

He is from Norway. He modified the structure of the play by the _retrospective method_: disregarding the traditional method of construction based on 3 phases (_antecedent_, _climax_, _conclusion_), he skipped the antecedent and started just before the climax.
He used the stage as an instrument for social criticism and for attacks on bourgeois hypocrisy.
He confronted his audience with real life problems, without indulging in humour or any other form of relief
Features of Ibsen’s plays:
- introduction of problem drama
- realism in characters and language
- psychological exploration
- rejection of sentimentalism
- rejection of conventional moral ending
- defence of women’s independence
- focus on middle class people
- social commitment

His influence was particularly evidente on the works of **George Bernard Shaw**, who was one of the main British playwright of the period. It is almost ironical to note that Wilde and Shaw had two opposite careers:
- during his life time Oscar Wilde's commedies were highly appreciated; he satires the values of the Victorian upper classes, but he did so in a very subtle way, which did not offend the people he was satirising; it was more Wilde's life and his homosexuality that made people turn the vindictively against him
- Shaw was an highly respected people, he was the model of decency, but his plays were not appreciated at the time, because they criticize to harshly the society of the time. He saw the theatre as an instrument for social and political change.
On the contrary Wilde denied the moral significant of art.

## Wilde's plays

### The importance of being Ernest

It was published in 1895, but before this commedy Wilde also wrote other very succesful comedies, such as
- Lady Windermere's Fan (1892)
- A Woman of No Importance (1893)
- An Ideal Husband (1895)

All these comedies revived the atmosphere of the comedy of manners. They contain witty epigrams, which give a vivid picture of the contemporary upper classes.
The society plays are different: the first three are more sentimental and melodramatic.

_The Importance of Being Earnest_ is more brilliant and unconventional. The theatrical elements are better balanced
