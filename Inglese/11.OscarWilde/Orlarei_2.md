# DRAMA  IN THE  VICTORIAN  AGE

The Victorian audience was made up of very ordinary people who went to the theatre to be amused and NOT to meditate on problems. They usually demanded 3 types of entertainment: farce, spectacle and above all melodrama.
The latter was particularly appreciated because of the morality it exhibited and because the spectator could easily identify with the hero.
The Victorian Age was an age of great actors who asked for high salaries.
The new theatres were smaller but more pretentious and could be afforded only by the well off. The staging was more spectacular, with more realistic stage effects, through the use of expensive theatrical machinery. This realistic staging had some negative consequences:
1. it was very expensive
2. it made it unprofitable to stage several plays during the same theatrical season
3. it led to a loss of flexibility because the managers preferred better known and already successful works, usually the great classics

In this period drama was changing and improving all over Europe.
Influences:
- Russia: **Chekhov**, who replaced the lack of action with a constant enquiry into the psychology of his characters
- Sweden: **Strindberg** provided a deeper insight into life, together with penetrating studies of women
- Norway: **Ibsen** modified the structure of the play by the retrospective method: disregarding the traditional method of construction based on 3 phases (antecedent, climax, conclusion), he skipped the antecedent and started just before the climax.
He used the stage as an instrument for social criticism and for attacks on bourgeois hypocrisy.
He confronted his audience with real life problems, without indulging in humour or any other form of relief
Features of Ibsen’s plays:
  - introduction of problem drama
  - realism in characters and language
  - psychological exploration
  - rejection of sentimentalism
  - rejection of conventional moral ending
  - defence of women’s independence
  - focus on middle class people
  - social commitment

# WILDE’S  PLAYS
## SOCIETY PLAYS
The society plays are different: the first three are more sentimental and melodramatic.

### The Importance of Being Earnest
is more brilliant and unconventional.
The theatrical elements are better balanced. Sentimentalism and melodrama are replaced by frivolous and absurd situations.
The main and secondary plots interweave in perfect unity and the characters are vividly sketched.
The language is sparkling and rich in witticism, epigrams, paradoxes and nonsense. No moral judgement ever intrudes, but only gentle satire on upper-class people.

The 4 characters are all well-off and members of aristocracy;
Gwendolen is resolute and helpful
Cecily is hurt and surprised
Jack is hesitant, nervous and indifferent with Algernon
Algernon is disconcerted and detached; indifferent to external problems, he is frivolous and superficial
The two girls join forces against the two men. The two pairs react to the discussion of serious problems by doing trivial things
The serious problems are: identity, marriage, social status, property, baptism.
The stage directions provide comments on the characters’ reactions. The wish of the two men of being baptized may be the symbol of their turning their backs on their old life and facing their new-married-life in an appropriate state of earnestness.

#### The Interview
Most important themes:
the institution of marriage
criticism about Victorian prudery and exaggerated seriousness, hypocrisy and absurdity
appearance is another important feature of the play
- pink: social cliches revealed by the dialogue
- yellow: topics of the conversation: smoking, age, education, income, possessions, family
- underlined blue: Lady Bracknell’s remarks
- green dots: the woman’s point of view on Jack’s origin

---

Lady Bracknell is frivolous, arrogant, empty-headed and privileged
The two characters reflect verbal humour
The stage information give information about facial expressions, gestures and tone of voice
The language is sophisticated, artificial and fit for characters who blong to the upper classes

Wilde’s two main targets of this play are social hipocrisy and the mercenary marriage market of the high societyof his age. His satire is good-humoured, the plot makes fun of the conventions of the day, the education, the relations between romantic love and the simplicity of the country.
