# OSCAR WILDE
* studiare ==pp. 124-125-126==

## The Preface
It can be considered the manifesto of the English Aesthetic Movement because it speaks about the subject of ART and the figure of the ARTIST; there are many repetitions to emphasize the writer’s THEME.
The language is epigrammatic, abstract, witty.
The artist is the creator of beautiful things, he is not interested in communicating his own ideas to mankind and he writes only to please himself.

## The Picture of Dorian Gray
Written in 1891.
The painter Basil Hallward is fascinated by the beauty of a rich, young man, Dorian Gray, and wants to fix it forever in a portrait. His friend Lord Henry, an aesthete who believes in nothing but beauty, initiates Dorian Gray into the cult of Aestheticism.
Dorian is so enchanted by his own beauty as it appears on the portrait that he wishes to preserve it for ever while the portrait ages in his place.
By some strange magic this is what happens: with the passing of time while Dorian’s youth is preserved intact, the portrait begins to show not only the marks of age, but also those of the immoral life he is leading under Lord Henry’s influence.
Entirely emancipated from Lord Henry’s patronage, Dorian becomes more and more involved in ambiguous adventures and also provokes the suicide of Sybil Vane, the girl who loved him passionately.
At the same time he becomes a follower of the aesthetic creed spread by the book “A Rebour”, written by the Belgian writer Huysmans in 1887; it describes the strange sensual experiences of its protagonist, Des Esseintes, who becomes the stereotype of the aesthete of fin de siecle literature.

## The Painter’s studio
The story is told by a third person narrator, who is unobtrusive. The characters belong to the upper middle class.
- Lines 1-15: in the description of the studio Wilde appeals to all senses: smell (_rich odour, heavy scent, more delicate perfume_) hearing (_sullen murmur, dim roar, bourdon note_) touch (_light summer wind, tussore silk curtains_) taste (_honey-sweet_) sight (_pink-flowering thorn, gleam, honey-colored blossoms, flame-like, shadow of birds, pallid jade-faced painters_).
- Lines 25-28: misapplied logic: what he says seems to be logic but actually it isn’t
- Lines 35-36: irony

The characters are introduced by what they say or do, or what other people say about them, and NOT by the narrator (typical of theatre)
Basil Hallward is an intellectual who tends to isolate himself from the rest of the world; Lord Henry’s way of speaking is humorous and satirical; he is a brilliant talker, but he is only apparently superficial and is able to carry on a stage criticism of some Victorian institutions: morality,  religion, marriage.

**Dorian Gray**, **Andrea Sperelli** and **Des Esseintes** are typical dandies, who live looking for beauty and elegance; they despise whatever is trivial and mediocre. Their provoking amoral experiences are described in a refined language.

Dorian experiences all kinds of life, sordid experiences as well as sophisticated adventures: he
 feels entitled to investigate all the possibilities offered by life, disregarding the limits imposed by conventional morality.

## Dorian’s death
The extract begins in a positive way. The girl refuses to believe he is wicked because he is not old nor ugly. He would like to change. He blames his own pride and passion for his situation, then the fact that he has received no punishment to purify him, and finally he blames his own youth and beauty.
He does not consider himself guilty for the death of Basil and Alan Campbell (suicide).
The only one thing he has done is to spare a young girl. He has decided he will never tempt innocence again.
The portrait does not change because this act of goodness has only been vanity, or another search for a new sensation or a consequence of his passion to ACT a part. His reaction is one of pain and indignation, not of remorse.
He rejects the idea of confession because he does not think that people will believe him as he has been so careful to get rid of evidence. He considers his portrait loathsome and he feels sorry and guilty for his behaviour. The portrait is the reflection of his own soul.

Before reaching the final desision to destroy the picture, he follows different STEPS:
1. Nostalgia for his pure boyhood (l.15-16)
2. Awareness of his corruption (l. 16-20)
3. Recollection of his pact to keep eternal youth (l. 21-23)
4. Wish for repentance and purification (l. 23-25)
5. Awareness that beauty and youth have caused his ruin (l. 34-38)
6. Wish to free himself from the past (l. 39-40, 50)
7. Understanding that repentance was pure illusion (l. 62-76)
8. Decision to destroy the picture (l. 96-99)

## Conclusion
The artist might consider the moral or immoral lives of people as part of his work, but ART itself is not meant to teach the public anything.
The true artist does not aim at proving anything and he makes no judgementof right or wrong.
What people call vices or virtues are merely materials for the artist.
Those who attempt to go beneath the surface of a work, or to find a particular meaning in a symbol, do so at their own risk.
Art exists for itself, it has no moral purpose.
