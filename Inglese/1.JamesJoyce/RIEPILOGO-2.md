He is one of the towering figures of modern literature. If Eliot was the central figure in modernist poetry, Joyce was the greatest genius in modernist prose.

He was a great experimenter, and he introduces the techniques of the stream of consciousness in the english novel.

His fundamental aim was to represents the human conditions as a universal and objective reality.
His concerns extended to mankind, and not only to his times.

Joyce was born in Dublin, but he spend most of his adult life abroad. He went on a sort of volountary exile, because he found people living in Ireland as narrow-minded, and he found the cultural atmosphere in Ireland as stagnant.
Ireland was to tied to the past, according to Joyce.

To him, Dublin was the centre of paralysis, and he chose this city for his book _Dubliners_.
It was the centre for all his fictional universe.

Critics agree that Joyce has made Dublin the capital of literary cities in the 20th century. Joyce turned Dublin into a microcosm of the whole universe. Dublin stands for the whole universe.

## _A Portrait of the Artist as a young man_

In his literary production Joyce brought this city to life again and again. Dublin isn't the setting only of _Dubliners_, but also of _A Portrait of the Artist as a young man_, which is his first novel, published in 1916. By the time Joyce came to write this novel, he had been away from Dublin for 10 years.

This prolonged temporal and geographical distance influence his method of evoking Dublin: in _Dubliners_ the city emerges as a concrete urban landscape, instead in _A Portrait of the Artist as a young man_ Dublin is filtered through the protagonist's consciousness; Dublin is no longer out there in the world, but it is inside the protagonist's imagination.

Here the **style** is less realistic that in Dubliners.

This novel deals with the spiritual development of a young man, and for this reason we can read this as a novel of education (or a Bildungsroman) [romanzo di formazione].

The protagonist is a Young irish writer, who is in search of experience and success.

The protagonist is internally divided between the standards of an ascetic religious upbringing and his desire for sensuousness.

This can be read as a novel of education, but this novel also appears to be very **autobiographical**.

In its depiction of the protagonist's childhood, adolescence, and gradual growth into a modern artist, this novel appears to be heavily autobiographical.
_A Portrait of the Artists as a young man_ is actually a Joyce's portrait. The protagonist is Joyce's fictional projection of himself.

The hero, Stephen Dedalus has many ==traits in common with the author==:
- he is the son of a poor father, as Joyce
- Stephen's mother is a fervent catholic woman, like Joyce's own mother
- Like Joyce, Stephen attend jesuit school
- Like Joyce, Stephen goes on a voluntary exile in Paris
The novel is mostly played in Dublin, but at the end the setting in place changes to Paris.
- Stephen rejected his people, his nation and his religion, to find fulfillment as a **martyr artist**, as Joyce
The protagonist name can be read as a symbol of a martyr artist:
  - Stephen remind us of **Saint Stephen**, the first martyr of christianity, who was accused of blasphemy, and he was stoned to death, because he was preaching a new religion; Stephen thinks of himself as a victim of incomprehention in his own land;
  - **Dedalus** is a mithological character, he was an artist and a skillful craftsman: he built the labyrinth for King Minos, and then he was imprisoned by the king within the labyrinth; Dedalus was able to escape from the labyrinth by creating two wax wings; Stephen Dedalus decided to leave Ireland on the winds of their own art.

Joyce preserved a cool detachment from his character.

Stephen lives in an ordinary, trivial and banal environment, which is too much in contrast with its inner aspirations.

At the end of the novel, Stephen experiences what the author call an **epiphany**: it's a moment of revelation, which enabled him to discover his true task in becoming an artist.
Becoming an artist is the only way to go beyond the mediocrity surrounding him, and it's the only way to achieve the deepest meaning of life.

The development of Stephen's consciousness is interesting since although it's described with a great objectivity it gives us an insight of the influences and the tensions that shaped Joyce's own mind.

In this novel through the character of Stephen, Joyce is able to insert a **programmatic manifesto** on what he sees as the **role of the modernist writer**.
In this novel Stephen work out a theory, according to which the artist is like the God of creation, that _remains within or behind or beyond or above his work_, invisible, refined out of existence and indifferent.

This is a view of art that implies **objectivity** and impersonality, even the exile of the artist, even though the artist actually uses material provided by his own life. The artist should not express his view point.
This idea of impersonality was present also in Eliot.

### Style

The novel begins with a third person narrator, and then it switches to a first person narrator. This first person narrator obviously further catapults us into ==Stephen's mind==.

The most famous aspect's of this novel is Joyce's innovative use of the **stream of consciousness**.
Through this technique the writer almost disappears, and the readers find themselves directly inside a character's mind.

Rather then describing character's sensations, feelings and thoughts from an external point of view, the stream of consciousness allows the author to directly transcribe the thoughts and the sensations that go through the character's mind.

Joyce develops the **language** from what it's appropriate to the small child of the first pages, to the articulate comments on art made by a university student, which is Stephen at the end of the novel.
The language changes through the novel, according to the protagonist growth.

It's peculiar the presence of **peaks of intensity** in the narration, that Joyce calls ==epiphanies==.
He explains what an epiphany is in a first draft of this novel: it's a sudden revelation in which the soul of the commonest object seems to us radiant.
It is a sudden spiritual awakening, when ordinary thoughts and feelings come together to produce a new awareness.

An epiphany is usually associated to an external element, which can be an object, a sound, a music, a sight of something, that triggers a new awareness.

### Structure

The novel is made up of five chapters, that follow chronologically Stephen life from childhood through adolescence until the age of 20.

The novel is mainly settled in Dublin, which is largely populated bu characters who closely resemble Joyce's family members, friends and enemies.

During the novel the protagonist go through a series of crucial transformations:

1. in the ==first part of the novel==, Stephen is a shy little boy, but at school he proves to be a **brilliant student**;
2. Stephen is leaved with a **prostitute**, and this is the protagonist's transition from innocence to corruption;
3. Stephen, from a sinner, decide to become a **fervent catholic**;
4. in the ==fourth chapter== there is the most important, when Stephen rejects his religiousness, to a new devotion to **art and beauty**; this transformation is reinforced in the last chapter, when he is finally an artist.

### T: *Where was his boyhood now?*

![Schermata 2021-05-30 alle 17.26.44](/assets/Schermata%202021-05-30%20alle%2017.26.44.png)![Schermata 2021-05-30 alle 17.27.21](/assets/Schermata%202021-05-30%20alle%2017.27.21_3v5pj2839.png)

The setting is a shore: Stephen is looking at the sea in front of him, he is looking at the sky and at the water, and he’s admiring this beautiful wild scenery.

There is very little action in the usual sense of the term, because here Joyce is more interested in Stephen’s emotions.

At the beginning Stephen is alone, and then he ears some childish voices: when he ear some children playing on the beach, he suddenly realises that his boyhood is over.

Then he notices a girl, and there is this beautiful description of the girl (**from line 25 to 30**), which gives an idea of elegance, purity, freedom, softness, purity, chastity.
This girl embodies these concepts.

When Stephen looks at the girl, he experiences an **epiphany**; he feels very excited and in this moment he expresses his wish to break free from all the constriction imposed by the Catholic Church and by the town of Dublin.

There are some negative expression related to his boyhood:

- **line 1**: *the grave of boyhood* linked to *grave clothes*
- **line 18**: _house of squalor_

These images convey the squalor of Stephen’s life.

#### Style

There is a third person narrator, while the POV is Stephen’s.

The language is Stephen’s language, and in order to reproduce Stephen’s thoughts Joyce uses different expression, and **free direct speech**:

- **line 1**: *Yes! Yes! Yes!*
- **line 6**: *On! On!*
- **lines 17-19**: *Where was... was he?*
- **line 43-44**: *To live... out of life*: this sentence reflects Stephen’s artistic creed
- **line 46**: *On and... and on!*

## *Dubliners*

He published it in 1914, but he finish writing this stories in 1907: he took him 7 years to get his book published.
It's a collection of fifteen stories, which are arranged in thematic sequence: we can distinguish four section, each one represents one stage in life: **childhood** (the *Sister*), **adolescence** (*Eveling*), **maturity** (*Clay*) and **public life** (*the Dead*)

### *The Dead*

![Schermata 2021-05-30 alle 17.28.58](/assets/Schermata%202021-05-30%20alle%2017.28.58_6jfrf8yhw.png)
![Schermata 2021-05-30 alle 17.29.18](/assets/Schermata%202021-05-30%20alle%2017.29.18.png)

It is the last story and the longer one, and probably the most important story.
The setting is always Dublin, since he saw it as the center of **paralysis**. Dublin is considered by Joyce the center of paralysis. All his fifteen stories reflect this feeling of stagnation and decay that Joyce associated with Ireland and with the city of Dublin.
The Dead can be read as the climax of this cultural and social stagnation.

This is the longest story, the most complex one, but it is also the most important because it it here that we find one of Joyces first examples of **indirect interior monologue**, a technique that he would master in his later production.

The style is still traditional in the whole book, and it is realistic: he portrays Dublin in a realistic way, and this book is still traditional, but the narration is often interspersed with moments of intensity: **ephipany**

It is an acute analysis of Dublin's life. There are fifteen stories in this collection, the settin is Dublin because it is the center of paralysis.

All the protagonists of this story experience this sense of paralyses, because they are all tied to their antiquated social and cultural tradition. They are also inhibited by repressive moral codes 

The Dead is the last story, and it is the climax of this feeling of stagnation that rounds trhough all the stories, that pervades all the stories.

Stilistically speaking Dubliners is still traditional, and it is characterized by a strong descriptive realism. It also includes some more innovative elements that will characterize his later production.
These innovative elements are
- absence of a moralizing narrator
- no presence of a onniscent narrator
- the stories are told trough the character's perspective, we follow their thoughts
- the story is often interspersed with moments of insights that Joyce calls ephipanies

In the final story, _the Dead_, Joyce goes beyond the earlier stories, because he produces a more compassionate view of the characters, there is a more intimate study of the characters and he moves away from the descriptive realism and from the objective presentation that characterize the rest of the book. This descriptive realism was the dominant approach in the rest of the book. In this last story, he partly abandons it, and he move towars a more intimate study of his characters.

In _the Dead_ we also find one of his first fully realized example of the interior monologue: it is used to reproduce the stream of consciousness that takes place in a persons mind.

_The Dead_ can be divided into two different sections:
- in the first section the protagonist, Gabriel Conroy, is at a dinner party
- in the second section we find a sort of musical coda, which contains the protagonist's reflections and meditation on what happened at the pary.

#### First section

The protagonist has two aunts, Julia and Kate Mokran, they are two elderly unmarried women, and they have the tradition of organizing a party every year during the christmas holidays, in which they invite all their family members and their friends, and so this is the occasion.

This party is held shortly after christmas, and this gathering is an occasion for Joyce to make a portrait of Dublin: there are people of different generation, there are people with different religion believes, and there are also different political simpaties. He makes a portrait of Dublin as the heart of modern Ireland, but more generally speaking Dublin becomes the heart of modern society.
He presents a microcosm that stands for modern society.

The high point of this party is a speech that Gabriel makes in front of everybody, and he is applauded by everyone, and so he feels exaltant, he is filled with self-love and self-satisfaction, he feels important.
The reals central event of the party is Gretta's Ephipany; she is Gabriel's wife, and she is also present at the party: during the party she hears an old irish song, and when she ears it she is on the stairs, and so she's paralysed on these stairs, as if time stopped for her, because that song reminded her of Michael Furey, her first love, and probably her only true love; she steps out of time and she goes back to her youth.

During Gretta's auditory ephipany there is also Gabriel's visual ephipany, that happen at the same time.
She stops on the stairs, and Gabriel looks at his life from the bottom of the stairs: she is like the figure of a painting, and this is probably the first time that he took some time to look at his wife in her whole appearance.

After the party they go to a near by Hotel, and during this walk Gabriel feels phisical desire for his wife, he remembers their courtship and their premarried life and all the happy moments of their married life. He is fillled with physical desire for his wife.

As soon as they reach the intimacy of the hotel bedroom, to his great astonishment, he discovers that his wife is crying, because she is thinking about Michael Feury. 
She explains him that during the party she had heard an old irish song, that had took her to her youth, and she tells him about Michael Furey, a boy who died for her when he was only seventeen; actually he died of pneumonia, but he contracted pneumonia after spending long ours in front of her house when it was snowing.

After this painfull memory Gretta falls asleep, because she is overwhelmed by the intensity of these past feelings. 

#### Second section

Here there are Gabriel's thoughts when his wife is sleeping. The setting loses any temporal connotation, since in Gabriel's thoughts past, present and future intermingle. He looks at his wife and he realizes that she is no longer the pretty girl that Micheal Furey had fallen in love with, he thinks about Michael Furey, he thinks about the past, and he realies that he played a poor part in his wife's life: their relationship was emotional insipide in comparison to her love affair with Micheal Furey

He understand that it is better to live a short life, but full of emotions and passion, than living a longer life which is passionless. Living a life in which everything fades away and there is nothing memorable to look back on.

He thinks about the future, because he imagines the funeral of one of his aunts. He makes some other reflection on death.

He feels the noise of the snow which is tapping on the windopane. He looks out of the window and the story ends with him looking at the snow which is covering the city of Dublin.

When Gabriel looked at the snow he experienced another epiphany. He meditates upon the intimate insignificance of even the most intense moments of life. The snow becomes a powerful symbol which can be interpretive in many different ways:

- **purity**: because of its colour (white) it can be seen as a symbol of purity; it seems to clear everything;
- **death**: it can also be read as a symbol of death. The snow falls upon the living and the dead, making everything indistinguishable It bares everything and the city becomes a cemetery; death is like a great leveller because when we died, we are all equal and it does not matter if someone has been poor or rich during life; the snow dissolves itself when it melts, another link to death;
- **paralysis**: it can be also seen as a symbol of paralysis because everything seems dead; the reader has the impression that the living characters are actually spiritually dead, to the point that they are more dead than Michael Fury, he’s physically dead, but alive in Greta’s heart.

It is in Joyce symbolism that we see it’s experimentation with the language. In his symbolism he experiments, it’s very innovative, whereas his realism is traditional.
We have the symbolism of the snow and than the symbolism of the names of the characters. In the extract, Gabriel and Michael are highlighted in pink. Gabriel is the name of the angel that plays the trumpet of the last judgment, Michael is also the name of an angel.
At a certain point he thinks about going “westward”, which is also a symbol. “going west word” is an idiomatic expression, it means dying. This expression makes us identify Gabriel with Joyce himself, we have the idea that Gabriel represents what Joyce would have become if he hadn’t left Ireland.

- The expressions underlined in blu, presents some examples of Joyce realistic descriptions.
- Those highlighted in light blue includes Gabriel thoughts expressed in past continuous or past simple, and represents the present of the narration.
- Those highlighted in green, includes Gabriel thoughts expressed in past perfect, this represent the past of the narration.
- Highlighted in yellow are those Gabriel’s expressions referred to the future of the narration.
- The grey arrows are lines that includes a passage from an outer reality to an inner reality.
- The red dots indicate moments of epiphany

## *Ulysses*

It was published in 1922 and this work marks a turning point in his career because his career can be generally divided in 2 different periods:

- **First period** is characterised by a traditional approach and the most significant work of the first period is *Dubliners*; we can also includes *A portrait of the artist of a Young man*. The plot is still quite linear and the syntax is still quite logical. The language reflects everyday language.
- **Second period**: it begins with *Ulysses* because it is a linguistic experiment. It was banned in Britain and American when it was published because it was considered too complex and incomprehensible. After *Ulysses* he dedicated his life to an even more complex work, *Finnegans Wakes* because he wanted to keep the literary historians busy for the next 400 years.

What changes between the periods is only the language because the setting is Dublin for both of them.

*Ulysses* takes as its material a single day, 16th June 1904,, the protagonists are two men and a woman, and the work is divided into three different sections, each one is dedicated to one of the central characters:

- **first section**: it is dedicated to Stephen Dedalus. “Steven” is the name of the first Christian martyr because we was accused of preaching a new religion. Also Stephen is treating badly by the Irish because tried to have a different approach to life. He is a craftsman (artigiano). Stephen has intellectual ambitions.
- **second section**: is about Leopold Bloom and he is an advertisement sales man. This morning he steps out of his house and starts wandering through the streets of Dublin and then he bumps into Stephen. They went into a brothel where they got drunk. Stephen had been evicted (sfrattato) from his house, so Leopold offers to take him into his house: so Leopold become a sort of protector father for Stephen. Leopold Bloom stands for Ulysses and Stephen stands for Telemachus.
- **third section**: it is focused on Leopold wife Molly Bloom which stands for Penelope (Ulysse’s wife). The difference is that Penelope was faithful to her husband while Leopold wife isn’t. While Leopold walks around the streets of Dublin, she spends time with another man.

This works wants to reproduce the classical one (made by Homer) and in fact Joyce Ulysses is structured in 18 episodes which parallel the same episodes that we find in Homers’ Odyssey even though in Joyce’s works we do not find the same order of Homer’s work.
This parallelism has got comic and parodic connotation because Joyce wants to show that modern men faces the same tragedies, triumphs, conflicts and problems of the classical heroes; the difference is that a modern man is no hero and he cannot rely on the God to help him through his struggles.

Ulysses is made up of 18 episodes, which are meant to reproduce similar episodes in Homer's text. The order in which these episodes are arranged is different from the classical text. Joyce wanted to demonstrate that the problems and the conflicts faced by modern man are the same problems and conflicts faced by men in classical times.

The difference is that the modern man is an anti-hero, cannot rely on the kindness of God;
it is exactly this ordinariness that made Leopold Bloom such a vital character: he is much more vital than Homer's Ulysses. Leopold Bloom, who stands for every man, contains a death and a vitality that no classical hero posseses.

Ulysses represents an high point of modernism, and this novel is full of examples of **interior monologue**. In this novel the reader follows the internal voyages of the character's mind, so the reader swims in the sea of thoughts and feelings of the characters. Joyce is brilliant in reproducing the workings of the mind. He adopt a very difficult language, since there is no punctuation, there are no connectors, the syntax is disjointed; there are often missing elements in a sentence. Reading Ulysses is like wearing earphones which are plugged into someone's brain.

An other reason for its complexity is the presence of different quotations or allusions to the whole of western literature and culture. This is a feature that we also found in Eliot. There's plenty of allusion, quotations, that refers to western literature and culture, that makes the text very complex. As we saw in Eliot there can be different levels of reading, according to how many references the reader is able to notice.
This novel is a sort of enciclopedic novel for its many allusions and quotations. This novel has been defined by some a "telephone directory" [guida telefonica] because many critics found that this novel could be read from the beginning to its end, but also from its and to the beginning; there is no logical linear sequence. 

It is a very complex novel, in which we find one of Joyce's best example of literary technique.

> disse che ero un fior di montagna / sì siamo tutti fiori / allora un corpo di donna / sì è stata una delle poche cose giuste che ha detto in vita sua / e il sole splende per te oggi / sì perciò mi piacque / sì perché vidi che capiva o almeno sentiva cos’è una donna / e io sapevo che me lo sarei rigirato come volevo / e gli detti quanto più piacere potevo per portarlo a quel punto / finché non mi chiese di dir di sì / e io dapprincipio non volevo rispondere / guardavo solo in giro il cielo e il mare / pensavo a tante cose che lui non sapeva / di Mulveyl e Mr Stanhope e Hester e papà e il vecchio capitano Groves / e i marinai che giocavano al piattello e alla cavallina come dicevan loro sul molo / e la sentinella davanti alla casa del governatore con quella cosa attorno all’elmetto bianco / povero diavolo mezzo arrostito / e le ragazze spagnole che ridevano nei loro scialli / e quei pettini alti / e le aste la mattina i Greci e gli ebrei e gli Arabi e il diavolo chi sa altro da tutte le parti d’Europa / e Duke street e il mercato del pollame / un gran pigolio davanti a Larby Sharonl / e i poveri ciuchini che inciampavano mezzi addormentati / e gli uomini avvolti nei loro mantelli / addormentati all’ombra sugli scalini / e le grandi ruote dei carri dei tori / e il vecchio castello vecchio di mill’anni / sì e quei bei Mori tutti in bianco / e turbanti come re / che ti chiedevano di metterti a sedere in quei loro buchi di botteghe / e Ronda con le vecchie finestre delle posadas / fulgidi occhi celava l’inferriata / perché il suo amante baciasse le sbarre / e le gargotte mezzo aperte la notte / e le nacchere / e la notte che perdemmo il battello ad Algesiras / il sereno che faceva il suo giro con la sua lampada / e Oh quel pauroso torrente laggiù in fondo / Oh e il mare / il mare qualche volta cremisi come il fuoco / e gli splendidi tramonti / e i fichi nei giardini dell’Alameda / sì e tutte quelle stradine curiose / e le case rosa e azzurre e gialle / e i roseti e i gelsomini e i geranii e i cactus / e Gibilterra da ragazza dov’ero un Fior di montagna / sì quando mi misi la rosa nei capelli / come facevano le ragazze andaluse / o ne porterò una rossa / sì / e come mi baciò sotto il muro moresco / e io pensavo be’ lui ne vale un altro / e poi gli chiesi con gli occhi di chiedere ancora / sì allora mi chiese se io volevo / sì dire di sì / mio fior di montagna / e per prima cosa gli misi le braccia intorno / sì e me lo tirai addosso / in modo che mi potesse sentire il petto tutto profumato / sì e il suo cuore batteva come impazzito / e sì dissi / sì voglio / sì.

It is taken from Molly Bloom famous monologue which ends Ulysses. This is a **direct interior monologue** (in the indirect interior monologue there is the guide of a narrator). There is no a narrator, and so it is more difficult to read. The thoughts are directly presented as they come in a character's mind.

Molly is at home, in bed, and she start thinking about her youth, she recalls the first encounter whit Leopold Bloom, and then the extracts end with her memory of Leopold Bloom marriage proposal.
The final words are

> Yes, I will, Yes

which refers to the marriage proposal

There are no signs of punctuation. It is difficult to go trough molly's thougts, since we don't know much about her past life, and so she jumps to one memory to one other, and then she thinks about the future; there is a difference of temporal planes.
Joyce basically doesn't select material on an estetic ground, but he preserves all the rubbish that passes through a character's mind.
