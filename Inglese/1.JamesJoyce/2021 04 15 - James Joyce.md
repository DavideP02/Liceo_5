# 15 apr 2021 - James Joyce

He is one of the towering figures of modern literature. If Eliot was the central figure in modernist poetry, Joyce was the greatest genius in modernist prose.

He was a great experimenter, and he introduces the techniques of the stream of consciousness in the english novel.

His fundamental aim was to represents the human conditions as a universal and objective reality.
His concerns extended to mankind, and not only to his times.

Joyce was born in Dublin, but he spend most of his adult life abroad. He went on a sort of volountary exile, because he found people living in Ireland as narrow-minded, and he found the cultural atmosphere in Ireland as stagnant.
Ireland was to tied to the past, according to Joyce.

To him, Dublin was the centre of paralysis, and he chose this city for his book _Dubliners_.
It was the centre for all his fictional universe.

Critics agree that Joyce has made Dublin the capital of literary cities in the 20th century. Joyce turned Dublin into a microcosm of the whole universe. Dublin stands for the whole universe.

## _A Portrait of the Artist as a young man_

In his literary production Joyce brought this city to life again and again. Dublin isn't the setting only of _Dubliners_, but also of _A Portrait of the Artist as a young man_, which is his first novel, published in 1916. By the time Joyce came to write this novel, he had been away from Dublin for 10 years.

This prolonged temporal and geographical distance influence his method of evoking Dublin: in _Dubliners_ the city emerges as a concrete urban landscape, instead in _A Portrait of the Artist as a young man_ Dublin is filtered through the protagonist's consciousness; Dublin is no longer out there in the world, but it is inside the protagonist's imagination.

Here the **style** is less realistic that in Dubliners.

This novel deals with the spiritual development of a young man, and for this reason we can read this as a novel of education (or a Bildungsroman) [romanzo di formazione].

The protagonist is a Young irish writer, who is in search of experience and success.
