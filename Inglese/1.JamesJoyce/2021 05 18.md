## *Dubliners*

He published it in 1914, but he finish writing this stories in 1907: he took him 7 years to get his book published.
It's a collection of fifteen stories, which are arranged in thematic sequence: we can distinguish four section, each one represents one stage in life: **childhood** (the *Sister*), **adolescence** (*Eveling*), **maturity** (*Clay*) and **public life** (*the Dead*)

### *The Dead*

It is the last story and the longer one, and probably the most important story.
The setting is always Dublin, since he saw it as the center of **paralysis**. Dublin is considered by Joyce the center of paralysis. All his fifteen stories reflect this feeling of stagnation and decay that Joyce associated with Ireland and with the city of Dublin.
The Dead can be read as the climax of this cultural and social stagnation.

This is the longest story, the most complex one, but it is also the most important because it it here that we find one of Joyces first examples of **indirect interior monologue**, a technique that he would master in his later production.

The style is still traditional in the whole book, and it is realistic: he portrays Dublin in a realistic way, and this book is still traditional, but the narration is often interspersed with moments of intensity: **ephipany**
