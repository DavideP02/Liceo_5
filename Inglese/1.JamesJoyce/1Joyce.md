## Biography

James Joyce is one of the most eminent personalities in English literature.
He was born in a suburb of Dublin in 1882, and his father was a lower class Irishman with a weakness for alcohol, so he was quite addicted.
The father was also interested in religion and politic.
The family was a big familiar, since they were **ten children**, and James was the eldest child
The mother was a fervent Roman Catholic, and when James decided to leave the Catholic Church the situation with his mother became difficult.

As they were very poor, he was able to get an education thanks to a serious of scholarships and school prizes.
He was educated at two Jesuit School, so he had an excellent traditional education. He was very much interested in philosophy and literature, modern languages, and he was especially interested in Italian, french and Norwegian, but through his life he acquired a knowledge of *18 languages*.
He wanted to study Norwegian because he wanted to read **Ibsen**

While he was a university student he decided to abandon catholic religion, and he developed the qualities of intellectual arrogance and intellectual **isolation** and pride. He was gifted with an exceptional memory, and a subtle intelligence, but he was physically weak, with weak eyes.

In October 1902 he graduated from university and he went to Paris to study medicine. He soon gave up and he returned to Dublin because his mother was dying. In that occasion he met Nora Barnacle who would later became his wife.
They married the 16 of June 1904 (The day Ulysses is settled).

The choice of leaving Dublin was the symbol of his rebellion to Ireland, and to being irish.

1. He rebelled against the Catholic Church, whose influence he saw as a limitation of his intellectual freedom.
2. He rebelled against Irish politics which he considered as a narrow [ristretto, angusto] provincial nationalism, while he believed in **cosmopolitan** ideal (or European).
3. He rebelled against Irish culture, which was according to him narrow and confining.
4. He rebelled against families ties, which were restrictive and inhibiting to his freedom.

After short stays in London, Paris and Zurich, in 1905 he settled in **Trieste** and he stayed there for 10 years.
Here he suffered extreme poverty, and 2 children were born there.

He always had great difficulties in publishing his books, but in the end, in 1914 he was able to publish *Dubliners*.
He then move to Zurich, and also in Zurich he suffered extreme poverty, and he had several operation at the eyes.

In 1916 he succeeded in publish *Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man*, and finally in 1922 his masterpiece *Ulysses* got published, and finally achieved financial security.

From 1922 to 1941 (when he died), he dedicated to *Finnegan wake*, that is too difficult to go through, because it is written in different languages, and also dream languages.

He is one of the towering figures of modern literature. If Eliot was the central figure in modernist poetry, Joyce was the greatest genius in modernist prose.

He was a great experimenter, and he introduces the techniques of the stream of consciousness in the english novel.

His fundamental aim was to represents the human conditions as a universal and objective reality.
His concerns extended to mankind, and not only to his times.

Joyce was born in Dublin, but he spend most of his adult life abroad. He went on a sort of volountary exile, because he found people living in Ireland as narrow-minded, and he found the cultural atmosphere in Ireland as stagnant.
Ireland was to tied to the past, according to Joyce.

To him, Dublin was the centre of paralysis, and he chose this city for his book _Dubliners_.
It was the centre for all his fictional universe.

Critics agree that Joyce has made Dublin the capital of literary cities in the 20th century. Joyce turned Dublin into a microcosm of the whole universe. Dublin stands for the whole universe.

## *Dubliners*

Dubliners is a collection of 15 short stories and the subject is the **decay and banality** of Dublin life.
They are **psychologically realistic sketches of urban life**, describing its atmosphere of disintegration with casual details, with charity and sympathy.

He published it in 1914, but he finish writing this stories in 1907: he took him 7 years to get his book published.
It's a collection of fifteen stories, which are arranged in thematic sequence: we can distinguish four section, each one represents one stage in life: **childhood** (the *Sister*), **adolescence** (*Eveling*), **maturity** (*Clay*) and **public life** (*the Dead*)

Very little happens in this stories, and Dublin is the **center of a paralysis**.
**Paralysis** is an important word, and this is the thematic word of the first story: *The syster*, and it indicates and intellectual, moral and spiritual paralysis, that derives from the accumulated failures of the disappointed lives of the frustrated people in Dublin.
The main themes of Joyces work are:

- Theme of the **city**
- Theme of the **artist**

### Theme of the city

Dublin is a special city, the only one in which Joyce is a citizen, because al the others are only places of exile.
It’s a city particular appropriate to him, and it is metropolitan and provincial at the same time.

### Theme of the artist

The modern artist is isolated from the community, and he rejects his environment.

### The language

Joyce uses the language that each character would have used, so he tries to adhere to the characters, and he describes the precise quality of their lives, using a style that is impersonal in appearance and economic and synthetic in its use of description.

Sensations, emotions and  ironical observations are rarely described at length [not in details], and language is mainly evocative.
James’s prose is extremely varied; for example the first story begins with a long passage written in simple language of a child, and then develops with an alternation of passages written in a style which is appropriate to the child’s aunt or the child himself, or the priest sister.

Joyce’s ability lies in writing lifelike dialogues and in reproducing the rhythm of irish speech.

### Common elements

There are some common elements in Dubliners:

1. The setting is **the city of Dublin**, which is both realistically individualised, with its streets, places, people, and made universal as the symbol of the modern metropolis, where human life is loosing its natural quality.
2. The main theme of all the stories is the same, which is the **failure to find a way out of paralysis**, which is the mental condition of people living in metropolis.
3. There is always an **epiphany**, which is the sudden revelation of an emblematic truth through a dialogue or through the description of an usual situation or a common object. [sorta di illuminazione]
4. **Narrator’s attitude** of compassionate irony and of friendly pity, through words of the protagonists of the story, who are never judged from a superior position. James Joyce abandons both the omniscience of the 19th century narrator and also the single point of view. So the story are told in the words of a character and from the perspective of a character.

---

### *The sisters*

The story starts *in medias res*. The child is speaking, and he is relating the death of priest, but as he is a child he is not sure that he priest has really died.
He will get sure when a visitor on his house came and announces the death of the priest.
But the child tries to hide his feeling and his sensations to his relatives. According to all the cotters the child should play with other children, The child hates all the cotters because they intrudes with comments in his life.
The child hates Old Cotter because he is a drunkard and because he spit in the fireplace. He feels hatred for Old Cotter.

After he goes to sleep he has a dream, since he was moved by the news of the death, and so he dreams of the priest

The reaction of the boy at the certainties (just through the note on the window) of the death is relief: he feels relieved and free.
So we get to know that there is a problem in the relationship between the child and the priest. This is an hint that there is something morbid and strange in their relationship.
We will get to know that there is something, but it is never expressed explicitly.

There are four characters involved:

- The boy (who is the narrator)
- His aunt
- Old Cotter
- Eliza (the sister who explains)

The situation is that the young boy gets to know that his former teacher of Latin and religious has died because of his third stroke.
The problem is that the boy is no unhappy, but instead he feels relieved and free.
There is a problem of pedophilia, which is only hinted and never made explicit. It’s told only his relief on priest’s death.

Old Cotter tells the child and relatives that the priest is died, but the child is still uncertain: he will go to the shop, and just after seeing the note on the glass he will be finally relieved

After this relief he went to bed, and dreamed about the Priest, and talk about paralysis.
He receives a confession from the priest, and the child feel like he is moving into a pleasant but vicious region. He confess his pedophilia and while doing it he smiles, with his lips wet of saliva. Then the child remember he is dead, and the child himself smiles, and this smile absolve the priest and his simony (sin of buying and selling religious privileges).
All this is not written explicitly.

James Joyce created a new way of writing: ==writer abdicates from is role and only characters are speaking==. He writes in the age of anxiety with Virginia Woolf. In fact here he tells the story from child’s point of view, and so he exaggerated all because of it.

The priest description (that came from the past life of the child from the priest) connotes him as shabby, sick, disgusting, sloppy, improper, filthy.

The child feels annoyed from relief he feels about the death of the priest. He feels annoyed because of the sense of guilt imposed by the church.

His relatives haven’t understood what was going on, and tells the child to feel sad because the priest was a good teacher. They list what he had taught to the child.

The priest is described through disgusting details about his physical appearance that show his lust. An example of many strange priest’s attitudes is:

> he used to smile pensively and nod his head, now and then pushing huge pinches of snuff up each nostril alternately. When he smiled he used to uncover his big discoloured teeth and let his tongue lie upon his lower lip—a habit which had made me feel uneasy in the beginning of our acquaintance before I knew him well.

The novel is divided into two parts, and between part 1 and 2 there is a **caesura**, which is when the child says what the priest had taught to him.
In the second part two characters are introduces, who are

1. **Nannie**, which is the diminutive of Anne (and also means “bambinaia”): she is the latter priest’s sister
2. **Father O’Rdurke**: he prepares the priest at all

Through the story we get to know that the protagonist is a child through some details:

- he enters the room on tiptoe, which is very childish
- he pretend to pray
- he tries to catch every detail, to be sure the priest is dead
- he declines food in order not to do noises

The priest was a **disappointed person**, a **failure**: he could have had a great career, but he didn’t exploit the position.

From the story that Eliza makes we get to know that the priest was disappointing for the two sisters: they expected him to became rich and successful.
On the contrary they praise Father O’Rourke as perfect, because he is clever, organized and powerful: he will probably make a career within the Church

The sister then talks about the only dream the priests had (which is with the sisters): we get to know that the priest has narrow perspective, he is simple-minded, since his only dream was to go and visit the house where he and his sisters were born.
During her speech she makes mistakes; her mastery of the language is quite limited: she is simple-minded and ignorant. Joyce is very good at reproducing this incorrect language.

Then there is the **epiphany**: the break of the chalice.
After this he began to mope by himself.
The chalice is the symbol of the choice of religious life, because in the chalice there is the transubstantiation; moreover it is particularly valuable, made in gold and decorated with jewels. So breaking it is the symbol of breaking the religious choice he did.

Maybe the breaking of the chalice represents also the denial of the promise made to God concerning the abstinence from sex.
James Flynn hasn’t respected his promise of chastity.

This act is the symbol of breaking the choice of his life: he realizes he is a disappointing life. The fall represents the complete failure of his life.

James Joyce was very critic against the Catholic Church. He resented the sense of guilt that the Jesuits had instilled in him.

### *Eveline*

The second story is the story connected to the period of adolescence. In fact Eveline is 19yo. She is an Irish girl, whose situation is quite bad for many reasons:

1. Her mother died prematurely of cancer.
2. Her father is a drunkard, he is violent, possessive, brutal and mean [avaro].
3. She is in charge of the house, so she is expected to do the cleaning and tidying.
4. She is also expected to look after her younger brother.
5. She works in a shop and the shop-owner ill treats her. She scolds her when the shop is crowded.
6. She has two elder brothers, but one is away for work and the other is dead.

All in all her life is very hard.
She has an opportunity of improving her life, by leaving Ireland with her boyfriend Frank.

#### First Part

Frank has proposed to go together to Buenos Aires. She is deciding what to do. The moment is topic because she has to choose whether to go or to stay.

The story take place at sunset, which is the moment of melancholy and meditation during the day. During the narration there is a sense of melancholy.
She uses the form *used to*, to describe habits in the past that aren’t so anymore.

Her father is introduced as a violent character.

We get to know from the very beginning that she will not go with Frank, because she is already looking for alibis, that justify her to stay, although the situation is very bad: she doesn’t have the strength to go.
She is looking at her house with the eyes of a person who is forced to leave: she feels desolate and she is repenting.

The reasons not to go are:

- She was surrounded by people she knew.
- In her house she had shelter and food.

She describes the fact that she has to give all her money to her father, and she feels in danger.
We get to know that are the two sons to support the family.

She was overwhelmed by all his due.

Then she talks about Frank. He is

- Kind
- Manly
- Open-hearted
- Suntanned, he has a dark complexion
- Cheerful
- Involved

Her father had forbidden her to meet Frank, so they had to meet secretly.

#### Second part

The second part is the part which prepares to the **epiphany**.
There is a turning point: *the evening deepened in the avenue*.

She had written 2 letters, to her brother and to her father.
So far she has been piling alibis not to go away, finding excuses.

Now she find a new excuses: her father will miss her. She remembers **two** occasions in her life when her father had been kind to her.

1. She was ill and her father had toasted [brindato] with her
2. They had been going on a trip and he had wore his wife’s bonnet to entertain the children.

Then the epiphany is starting when the sound of a barrel-organ, which play a song that reminds her of her mother, and the promise she made to her to keep the family together.
She remembers also the death of her mother.

The reasons not to go now are four:

1. She knows everything at home
2. She has shelter and food
3. Her father is getting old and will need and miss her
4. She had promised to her mother to keep the family together and care about the children.

#### Final part

Then she gathers the strength to leave.

The final part is very sad, she has meditated and she has listed all the reasons to stay, then she has a sudden impulse to go to the docks [porto] (she hasn’t decided yet), and at the docks she experiences her **epiphany**.

*The boat blew a long ==mournful== whistle into the mist*
This is an anticipation.

She decides to stay, triggered by the **mournful** whistle.

She realises she is losing something vital to her, the only chance to fulfil her life.
She is paralysed by the fear of the unknown, and she realises she will always be a slave and a loser.

The story reminds us of Nora Barnacle, who was Joyce’s wife, who left Ireland with him

#### *Clay*

When in Great Britain you are christened the priest says “you are clay” [Tu sei polvere e polvere ritornerai]
The difference between **clay** and **dust** is that dust flies, while clay is wet.

Clay is the material used to make bricks, but it also mean mud and earth in general. It’s a reference to the mortal body of man. So there is an anticipation of death

The protagonist’s name is **Maria**, which is pronounced “Meraia”.
The Black Maria was a van used to transport prisoners to the scaffold.

Maria is middle aged and horrible.

- She had a long nose, so that when she laughs her nose and chin touched.
- She is a spinster [zitella]
- she works in a laundry and she is a cook.
- She is very much appreciated because of her **nice character** and personality. Her companion say she is a peacemaker

Her problem is that she has a goal in her life, which is to **get married**. She still haven’t lost hopes.
Instead there are few possibilities, because she is unattractive and she works with only women.

The story is centered on the sterility and humility of **celibacy**.
The protagonist ignore vital impulses: she is probably a **maiden** [virgin] and she is quit unaware and unskilled, but she still hopes and she thinks that her life will be fulfilled by the meeting of a men.

Her companion had understood this, and they gently mock her. She is disappointed by these mocks, she feels upset.
A woman say she wants a **ring** (*first reference to ring*). She always tells lies about this, saying she didn’t need a man.

She is going to visit one of the two br other (**Joe** and **Alfie**) whom she looked after when she was young.

- The two brothers had fallen out.
- They were very close to her.
- They also helped her to find a job

While getting ready to go out she still find herself attractive.
She gets the bus and then she go to the *confectioner’s*.

Here there is the second reference to the ring and marriage. The owner, in fact, since she was spending too much time in choosing a plum-cake into the confectioner’s, asks whether she was going to chose her **wedding cake**. She *blushes*.

On the tram she meet a **gentleman**, who talk with her. She was so excited to have talked to a man that she forget her plum-cakes. But in reality the man had talked to her just because *he was tipsy* [brillo].

When she gets her guests house, she realizes she lost her plum-cake.
We get to know that she isn’t so good as person because when she realizes of the lost of plum-cake *she accused the children* instead of taking responsibility.

The children will take **revenge** on her.

Before the epiphany there is an attempt of Maria to bring Joe and Alfie together, but there is no possibility.

She is coaxed [blandita] to play; it’s a game in which you get to know what will be your future: she is blindfolded and lead to a table with saucers to chose from. They can choose from

- Ring
- Bible: you will became a nun or a priest
- Water: open destiny

The children instead **add clay**, which means death, as a revenge.

**Epiphany**: she chooses clay, but at a second attempt, made since an adult understood what was going on, she chooses the Bible. There is **no possibility** to her to get married, so either she will die or she will enter a convent.

Life tells her there is nothing for her, but **clay** and **the prayer book**. She realises her life of dream is over and it is like **Eveline**, but sadder.

However she doesn’t give up.
She had to sing a song, but she changes the words of the song and in the new words she dreams to have a lot of suitors [pretendenti]. No one tried to show her her mistake.

She is even more pitiful because she doesn’t accept reality and her destiny. She has just get to realise that her life is over but she can’t.

### *The Dead*

![Schermata 2021-05-30 alle 17.28.58](/assets/Schermata%202021-05-30%20alle%2017.28.58_6jfrf8yhw.png)
![Schermata 2021-05-30 alle 17.29.18](/assets/Schermata%202021-05-30%20alle%2017.29.18.png)

It is the last story and the longer one, and probably the most important story.
The setting is always Dublin, since he saw it as the center of **paralysis**. Dublin is considered by Joyce the center of paralysis. All his fifteen stories reflect this feeling of stagnation and decay that Joyce associated with Ireland and with the city of Dublin.
The Dead can be read as the climax of this cultural and social stagnation.

This is the longest story, the most complex one, but it is also the most important because it it here that we find one of Joyces first examples of **indirect interior monologue**, a technique that he would master in his later production.

The style is still traditional in the whole book, and it is realistic: he portrays Dublin in a realistic way, and this book is still traditional, but the narration is often interspersed with moments of intensity: **ephipany**

It is an acute analysis of Dublin's life. There are fifteen stories in this collection, the settin is Dublin because it is the center of paralysis.

All the protagonists of this story experience this sense of paralyses, because they are all tied to their antiquated social and cultural tradition. They are also inhibited by repressive moral codes

The Dead is the last story, and it is the climax of this feeling of stagnation that rounds trhough all the stories, that pervades all the stories.

Stilistically speaking Dubliners is still traditional, and it is characterized by a strong descriptive realism. It also includes some more innovative elements that will characterize his later production.
These innovative elements are

- absence of a moralizing narrator
- no presence of a onniscent narrator
- the stories are told trough the character's perspective, we follow their thoughts
- the story is often interspersed with moments of insights that Joyce calls ephipanies

In the final story, _the Dead_, Joyce goes beyond the earlier stories, because he produces a more compassionate view of the characters, there is a more intimate study of the characters and he moves away from the descriptive realism and from the objective presentation that characterize the rest of the book. This descriptive realism was the dominant approach in the rest of the book. In this last story, he partly abandons it, and he move towars a more intimate study of his characters.

In _the Dead_ we also find one of his first fully realized example of the interior monologue: it is used to reproduce the stream of consciousness that takes place in a persons mind.

_The Dead_ can be divided into two different sections:

- in the first section the protagonist, Gabriel Conroy, is at a dinner party
- in the second section we find a sort of musical coda, which contains the protagonist's reflections and meditation on what happened at the pary.

#### First section

The protagonist has two aunts, Julia and Kate Mokran, they are two elderly unmarried women, and they have the tradition of organizing a party every year during the christmas holidays, in which they invite all their family members and their friends, and so this is the occasion.

This party is held shortly after christmas, and this gathering is an occasion for Joyce to make a portrait of Dublin: there are people of different generation, there are people with different religion believes, and there are also different political simpaties. He makes a portrait of Dublin as the heart of modern Ireland, but more generally speaking Dublin becomes the heart of modern society.
He presents a microcosm that stands for modern society.

The high point of this party is a speech that Gabriel makes in front of everybody, and he is applauded by everyone, and so he feels exaltant, he is filled with self-love and self-satisfaction, he feels important.
The reals central event of the party is Gretta's Ephipany; she is Gabriel's wife, and she is also present at the party: during the party she hears an old irish song, and when she ears it she is on the stairs, and so she's paralysed on these stairs, as if time stopped for her, because that song reminded her of Michael Furey, her first love, and probably her only true love; she steps out of time and she goes back to her youth.

During Gretta's auditory ephipany there is also Gabriel's visual ephipany, that happen at the same time.
She stops on the stairs, and Gabriel looks at his life from the bottom of the stairs: she is like the figure of a painting, and this is probably the first time that he took some time to look at his wife in her whole appearance.

After the party they go to a near by Hotel, and during this walk Gabriel feels phisical desire for his wife, he remembers their courtship and their premarried life and all the happy moments of their married life. He is fillled with physical desire for his wife.

As soon as they reach the intimacy of the hotel bedroom, to his great astonishment, he discovers that his wife is crying, because she is thinking about Michael Feury.
She explains him that during the party she had heard an old irish song, that had took her to her youth, and she tells him about Michael Furey, a boy who died for her when he was only seventeen; actually he died of pneumonia, but he contracted pneumonia after spending long ours in front of her house when it was snowing.

After this painfull memory Gretta falls asleep, because she is overwhelmed by the intensity of these past feelings.

#### Second section

Here there are Gabriel's thoughts when his wife is sleeping. The setting loses any temporal connotation, since in Gabriel's thoughts past, present and future intermingle. He looks at his wife and he realizes that she is no longer the pretty girl that Micheal Furey had fallen in love with, he thinks about Michael Furey, he thinks about the past, and he realies that he played a poor part in his wife's life: their relationship was emotional insipide in comparison to her love affair with Micheal Furey

He understand that it is better to live a short life, but full of emotions and passion, than living a longer life which is passionless. Living a life in which everything fades away and there is nothing memorable to look back on.

He thinks about the future, because he imagines the funeral of one of his aunts. He makes some other reflection on death.

He feels the noise of the snow which is tapping on the windopane. He looks out of the window and the story ends with him looking at the snow which is covering the city of Dublin.

When Gabriel looked at the snow he experienced another epiphany. He meditates upon the intimate insignificance of even the most intense moments of life. The snow becomes a powerful symbol which can be interpretive in many different ways:

- **purity**: because of its colour (white) it can be seen as a symbol of purity; it seems to clear everything;
- **death**: it can also be read as a symbol of death. The snow falls upon the living and the dead, making everything indistinguishable It bares everything and the city becomes a cemetery; death is like a great leveller because when we died, we are all equal and it does not matter if someone has been poor or rich during life; the snow dissolves itself when it melts, another link to death;
- **paralysis**: it can be also seen as a symbol of paralysis because everything seems dead; the reader has the impression that the living characters are actually spiritually dead, to the point that they are more dead than Michael Fury, he’s physically dead, but alive in Greta’s heart.

It is in Joyce symbolism that we see it’s experimentation with the language. In his symbolism he experiments, it’s very innovative, whereas his realism is traditional.
We have the symbolism of the snow and than the symbolism of the names of the characters. In the extract, Gabriel and Michael are highlighted in pink. Gabriel is the name of the angel that plays the trumpet of the last judgment, Michael is also the name of an angel.
At a certain point he thinks about going “westward”, which is also a symbol. “going west word” is an idiomatic expression, it means dying. This expression makes us identify Gabriel with Joyce himself, we have the idea that Gabriel represents what Joyce would have become if he hadn’t left Ireland.

- The expressions underlined in blu, presents some examples of Joyce realistic descriptions.
- Those highlighted in light blue includes Gabriel thoughts expressed in past continuous or past simple, and represents the present of the narration.
- Those highlighted in green, includes Gabriel thoughts expressed in past perfect, this represent the past of the narration.
- Highlighted in yellow are those Gabriel’s expressions referred to the future of the narration.
- The grey arrows are lines that includes a passage from an outer reality to an inner reality.
- The red dots indicate moments of epiphany

## _A Portrait of the Artist as a young man_

In his literary production Joyce brought this city to life again and again. Dublin isn't the setting only of _Dubliners_, but also of _A Portrait of the Artist as a young man_, which is his first novel, published in 1916. By the time Joyce came to write this novel, he had been away from Dublin for 10 years.

This prolonged temporal and geographical distance influence his method of evoking Dublin: in _Dubliners_ the city emerges as a concrete urban landscape, instead in _A Portrait of the Artist as a young man_ Dublin is filtered through the protagonist's consciousness; Dublin is no longer out there in the world, but it is inside the protagonist's imagination.

Here the **style** is less realistic that in Dubliners.

This novel deals with the spiritual development of a young man, and for this reason we can read this as a novel of education (or a Bildungsroman) [romanzo di formazione].

The protagonist is a Young irish writer, who is in search of experience and success.

The protagonist is internally divided between the standards of an ascetic religious upbringing and his desire for sensuousness.

This can be read as a novel of education, but this novel also appears to be very **autobiographical**.

In its depiction of the protagonist's childhood, adolescence, and gradual growth into a modern artist, this novel appears to be heavily autobiographical.
_A Portrait of the Artists as a young man_ is actually a Joyce's portrait. The protagonist is Joyce's fictional projection of himself.

The hero, Stephen Dedalus has many ==traits in common with the author==:

- he is the son of a poor father, as Joyce
- Stephen's mother is a fervent catholic woman, like Joyce's own mother
- Like Joyce, Stephen attend jesuit school
- Like Joyce, Stephen goes on a voluntary exile in Paris
The novel is mostly played in Dublin, but at the end the setting in place changes to Paris.
- Stephen rejected his people, his nation and his religion, to find fulfillment as a **martyr artist**, as Joyce
The protagonist name can be read as a symbol of a martyr artist:
  - Stephen remind us of **Saint Stephen**, the first martyr of christianity, who was accused of blasphemy, and he was stoned to death, because he was preaching a new religion; Stephen thinks of himself as a victim of incomprehention in his own land;
  - **Dedalus** is a mithological character, he was an artist and a skillful craftsman: he built the labyrinth for King Minos, and then he was imprisoned by the king within the labyrinth; Dedalus was able to escape from the labyrinth by creating two wax wings; Stephen Dedalus decided to leave Ireland on the winds of their own art.

Joyce preserved a cool detachment from his character.

Stephen lives in an ordinary, trivial and banal environment, which is too much in contrast with its inner aspirations.

At the end of the novel, Stephen experiences what the author call an **epiphany**: it's a moment of revelation, which enabled him to discover his true task in becoming an artist.
Becoming an artist is the only way to go beyond the mediocrity surrounding him, and it's the only way to achieve the deepest meaning of life.

The development of Stephen's consciousness is interesting since although it's described with a great objectivity it gives us an insight of the influences and the tensions that shaped Joyce's own mind.

In this novel through the character of Stephen, Joyce is able to insert a **programmatic manifesto** on what he sees as the **role of the modernist writer**.
In this novel Stephen work out a theory, according to which the artist is like the God of creation, that _remains within or behind or beyond or above his work_, invisible, refined out of existence and indifferent.

This is a view of art that implies **objectivity** and impersonality, even the exile of the artist, even though the artist actually uses material provided by his own life. The artist should not express his view point.
This idea of impersonality was present also in Eliot.

### Style

The novel begins with a third person narrator, and then it switches to a first person narrator. This first person narrator obviously further catapults us into ==Stephen's mind==.

The most famous aspect's of this novel is Joyce's innovative use of the **stream of consciousness**.
Through this technique the writer almost disappears, and the readers find themselves directly inside a character's mind.

Rather then describing character's sensations, feelings and thoughts from an external point of view, the stream of consciousness allows the author to directly transcribe the thoughts and the sensations that go through the character's mind.

Joyce develops the **language** from what it's appropriate to the small child of the first pages, to the articulate comments on art made by a university student, which is Stephen at the end of the novel.
The language changes through the novel, according to the protagonist growth.

It's peculiar the presence of **peaks of intensity** in the narration, that Joyce calls ==epiphanies==.
He explains what an epiphany is in a first draft of this novel: it's a sudden revelation in which the soul of the commonest object seems to us radiant.
It is a sudden spiritual awakening, when ordinary thoughts and feelings come together to produce a new awareness.

An epiphany is usually associated to an external element, which can be an object, a sound, a music, a sight of something, that triggers a new awareness.

### Structure

The novel is made up of five chapters, that follow chronologically Stephen life from childhood through adolescence until the age of 20.

The novel is mainly settled in Dublin, which is largely populated bu characters who closely resemble Joyce's family members, friends and enemies.

During the novel the protagonist go through a series of crucial transformations:

1. in the ==first part of the novel==, Stephen is a shy little boy, but at school he proves to be a **brilliant student**;
2. Stephen is leaved with a **prostitute**, and this is the protagonist's transition from innocence to corruption;
3. Stephen, from a sinner, decide to become a **fervent catholic**;
4. in the ==fourth chapter== there is the most important, when Stephen rejects his religiousness, to a new devotion to **art and beauty**; this transformation is reinforced in the last chapter, when he is finally an artist.

### T: *Where was his boyhood now?*

The setting is a shore: Stephen is looking at the sea in front of him, he is looking at the sky and at the water, and he’s admiring this beautiful wild scenery.

There is very little action in the usual sense of the term, because here Joyce is more interested in Stephen’s emotions.

At the beginning Stephen is alone, and then he ears some childish voices: when he ear some children playing on the beach, he suddenly realises that his boyhood is over.

Then he notices a girl, and there is this beautiful description of the girl (**from line 25 to 30**), which gives an idea of elegance, purity, freedom, softness, purity, chastity.
This girl embodies these concepts.

When Stephen looks at the girl, he experiences an **epiphany**; he feels very excited and in this moment he expresses his wish to break free from all the constriction imposed by the Catholic Church and by the town of Dublin.

There are some negative expression related to his boyhood:

- **line 1**: *the grave of boyhood* linked to *grave clothes*
- **line 18**: _house of squalor_

These images convey the squalor of Stephen’s life.

#### Style

There is a third person narrator, while the POV is Stephen’s.

The language is Stephen’s language, and in order to reproduce Stephen’s thoughts Joyce uses different expression, and **free direct speech**:

- **line 1**: *Yes! Yes! Yes!*
- **line 6**: *On! On!*
- **lines 17-19**: *Where was... was he?*
- **line 43-44**: *To live... out of life*: this sentence reflects Stephen’s artistic creed
- **line 46**: *On and... and on!*

## *Ulysses*

It was published in 1922 and this work marks a turning point in his career because his career can be generally divided in 2 different periods:

- **First period** is characterised by a traditional approach and the most significant work of the first period is *Dubliners*; we can also includes *A portrait of the artist of a Young man*. The plot is still quite linear and the syntax is still quite logical. The language reflects everyday language.
- **Second period**: it begins with *Ulysses* because it is a linguistic experiment. It was banned in Britain and American when it was published because it was considered too complex and incomprehensible. After *Ulysses* he dedicated his life to an even more complex work, *Finnegans Wakes* because he wanted to keep the literary historians busy for the next 400 years.

What changes between the periods is only the language because the setting is Dublin for both of them.

*Ulysses* takes as its material a single day, 16th June 1904,, the protagonists are two men and a woman, and the work is divided into three different sections, each one is dedicated to one of the central characters:

- **first section**: it is dedicated to Stephen Dedalus. “Steven” is the name of the first Christian martyr because we was accused of preaching a new religion. Also Stephen is treating badly by the Irish because tried to have a different approach to life. He is a craftsman (artigiano). Stephen has intellectual ambitions.
- **second section**: is about Leopold Bloom and he is an advertisement sales man. This morning he steps out of his house and starts wandering through the streets of Dublin and then he bumps into Stephen. They went into a brothel where they got drunk. Stephen had been evicted (sfrattato) from his house, so Leopold offers to take him into his house: so Leopold become a sort of protector father for Stephen. Leopold Bloom stands for Ulysses and Stephen stands for Telemachus.
- **third section**: it is focused on Leopold wife Molly Bloom which stands for Penelope (Ulysse’s wife). The difference is that Penelope was faithful to her husband while Leopold wife isn’t. While Leopold walks around the streets of Dublin, she spends time with another man.

This works wants to reproduce the classical one (made by Homer) and in fact Joyce Ulysses is structured in 18 episodes which parallel the same episodes that we find in Homers’ Odyssey even though in Joyce’s works we do not find the same order of Homer’s work.
This parallelism has got comic and parodic connotation because Joyce wants to show that modern men faces the same tragedies, triumphs, conflicts and problems of the classical heroes; the difference is that a modern man is no hero and he cannot rely on the God to help him through his struggles.

Ulysses is made up of 18 episodes, which are meant to reproduce similar episodes in Homer's text. The order in which these episodes are arranged is different from the classical text. Joyce wanted to demonstrate that the problems and the conflicts faced by modern man are the same problems and conflicts faced by men in classical times.

The difference is that the modern man is an anti-hero, cannot rely on the kindness of God;
it is exactly this ordinariness that made Leopold Bloom such a vital character: he is much more vital than Homer's Ulysses. Leopold Bloom, who stands for every man, contains a death and a vitality that no classical hero posseses.

Ulysses represents an high point of modernism, and this novel is full of examples of **interior monologue**. In this novel the reader follows the internal voyages of the character's mind, so the reader swims in the sea of thoughts and feelings of the characters. Joyce is brilliant in reproducing the workings of the mind. He adopt a very difficult language, since there is no punctuation, there are no connectors, the syntax is disjointed; there are often missing elements in a sentence. Reading Ulysses is like wearing earphones which are plugged into someone's brain.

An other reason for its complexity is the presence of different quotations or allusions to the whole of western literature and culture. This is a feature that we also found in Eliot. There's plenty of allusion, quotations, that refers to western literature and culture, that makes the text very complex. As we saw in Eliot there can be different levels of reading, according to how many references the reader is able to notice.
This novel is a sort of enciclopedic novel for its many allusions and quotations. This novel has been defined by some a "telephone directory" [guida telefonica] because many critics found that this novel could be read from the beginning to its end, but also from its and to the beginning; there is no logical linear sequence.

It is a very complex novel, in which we find one of Joyce's best example of literary technique.

It is taken from Molly Bloom famous monologue which ends Ulysses. This is a **direct interior monologue** (in the indirect interior monologue there is the guide of a narrator). There is no a narrator, and so it is more difficult to read. The thoughts are directly presented as they come in a character's mind.

Molly is at home, in bed, and she start thinking about her youth, she recalls the first encounter whit Leopold Bloom, and then the extracts end with her memory of Leopold Bloom marriage proposal.
The final words are

> Yes, I will, Yes

which refers to the marriage proposal

There are no signs of punctuation. It is difficult to go trough molly's thougts, since we don't know much about her past life, and so she jumps to one memory to one other, and then she thinks about the future; there is a difference of temporal planes.
Joyce basically doesn't select material on an estetic ground, but he preserves all the rubbish that passes through a character's mind.
