## _A Portrait of the Artist as a young man_

The protagonist is internally divided between the standards of an ascetic religious upbringing and his desire for sensuousness.

This can be read as a novel of education, but this novel also appears to be very **autobiographical**.

In its depiction of the protagonist's childhood, adolescence, and gradual growth into a modern artist, this novel appears to be heavily autobiographical.
_A Portrait of the Artists as a young man_ is actually a Joyce's portrait. The protagonist is Joyce's fictional projection of himself.

The hero, Stephen Dedalus has many ==traits in common with the author==:
- he is the son of a poor father, as Joyce
- Stephen's mother is a fervent catholic woman, like Joyce's own mother
- Like Joyce, Stephen attend jesuit school
- Like Joyce, Stephen goes on a voluntary exile in Paris
The novel is mostly played in Dublin, but at the end the setting in place changes to Paris.
- Stephen rejected his people, his nation and his religion, to find fulfillment as a **martyr artist**, as Joyce
The protagonist name can be read as a symbol of a martyr artist:
  - Stephen remind us of **Saint Stephen**, the first martyr of christianity, who was accused of blasphemy, and he was stoned to death, because he was preaching a new religion; Stephen thinks of himself as a victim of incomprehention in his own land;
  - **Dedalus** is a mithological character, he was an artist and a skillful craftsman: he built the labyrinth for King Minos, and then he was imprisoned by the king within the labyrinth; Dedalus was able to escape from the labyrinth by creating two wax wings; Stephen Dedalus decided to leave Ireland on the winds of their own art.

Joyce preserved a cool detachment from his character.

Stephen lives in an ordinary, trivial and banal environment, which is too much in contrast with its inner aspirations.

At the end of the novel, Stephen experiences what the author call an **epiphany**: it's a moment of revelation, which enabled him to discover his true task in becoming an artist.
Becoming an artist is the only way to go beyond the mediocrity surrounding him, and it's the only way to achieve the deepest meaning of life.

The development of Stephen's consciousness is interesting since although it's described with a great objectivity it gives us an insight of the influences and the tensions that shaped Joyce's own mind.

In this novel through the character of Stephen, Joyce is able to insert a **programmatic manifesto** on what he sees as the **role of the modernist writer**.
In this novel Stephen work out a theory, according to which the artist is like the God of creation, that _remains within or behind or beyond or above his work_, invisible, refined out of existence and indifferent.

This is a view of art that implies **objectivity** and impersonality, even the exile of the artist, even though the artist actually uses material provided by his own life. The artist should not express his view point.
This idea of impersonality was present also in Eliot.

### Style

The novel begins with a third person narrator, and then it switches to a first person narrator. This first person narrator obviously further catapults us into ==Stephen's mind==.

The most famous aspect's of this novel is Joyce's innovative use of the **stream of consciousness**.
Through this technique the writer almost disappears, and the readers find themselves directly inside a character's mind.

Rather then describing character's sensations, feelings and thoughts from an external point of view, the stream of consciousness allows the author to directly transcribe the thoughts and the sensations that go through the character's mind.

Joyce develops the **language** from what it's appropriate to the small child of the first pages, to the articulate comments on art made by a university student, which is Stephen at the end of the novel.
The language changes through the novel, according to the protagonist growth.

It's peculiar the presence of **peaks of intensity** in the narration, that Joyce calls ==epiphanies==.
He explains what an epiphany is in a first draft of this novel: it's a sudden revelation in which the soul of the commonest object seems to us radiant.
It is a sudden spiritual awakening, when ordinary thoughts and feelings come together to produce a new awareness.

An epiphany is usually associated to an external element, which can be an object, a sound, a music, a sight of something, that triggers a new awareness.

### Structure

The novel is made up of five chapters, that follow chronologically Stephen life from childhood through adolescence until the age of 20.

The novel is mainly settled in Dublin, which is largely populated bu characters who closely resemble Joyce's family members, friends and enemies.

During the novel the protagonist go through a series of crucial transformations:
1. in the ==first part of the novel==, Stephen is a shy little boy, but at school he proves to be a **brilliant student**;
2. Stephen is leaved with a **prostitute**, and this is the protagonist's transition from innocence to corruption;
3. Stephen, from a sinner, decide to become a **fervent catholic**;
4. in the ==fourth chapter== there is the most important, when Stephen rejects his religiousness, to a new devotion to **art and beauty**; this transformation is reinforced in the last chapter, when he is finally an artist.
