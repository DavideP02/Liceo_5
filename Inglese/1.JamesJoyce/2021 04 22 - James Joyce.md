## T: Where was his boyhood now?
- ==p. 216==

The setting is a shore: Stephen is looking at the sea in front of him, he is looking at the sky and at the water, and he’s admiring this beautiful wild scenery.

There is very little action in the usual sense of the term, because here Joyce is more interested in Stephen’s emotions.

At the beginning Stephen is alone, and then he ears some childish voices: when he ear some children playing on the beach, he suddenly realises that his boyhood is over.

Then he notices a girl, and there is this beautiful description of the girl (**from line 25 to 30**), which gives an idea of elegance, purity, freedom, softness, purity, chastity.
This girl embodies these concepts.

When Stephen looks at the girl, he experiences an **epiphany**; he feels very excited and in this moment he expresses his wish to break free from all the constriction imposed by the Catholic Church and by the town of Dublin.

There are some negative expression related to his boyhood ( TODO ==segnare da slide 4==).

These images convey the squalor of Stephen’s life.

### Style
There is a third person narrator, while the POV is Stephen’s.

The language is Stephen’s language, and in order to reproduce Stephen’s thoughts Joyce uses different expression, and **free direct speech** ( TODO aggiungere esempi ==slide 5==)

- **line 43-44**: this sentence reflects Stephen’s artistic creed
