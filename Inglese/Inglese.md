# James Joyce

## Biography

James Joyce is one of the most eminent personalities in English literature.
He was born in a suburb of Dublin in 1882, and his father was a lower class Irishman with a weakness for alcohol, so he was quite addicted.
The father was also interested in religion and politic.
The family was a big familiar, since they were **ten children**, and James was the eldest child
The mother was a fervent Roman Catholic, and when James decided to leave the Catholic Church the situation with his mother became difficult.

As they were very poor, he was able to get an education thanks to a serious of scholarships and school prizes.
He was educated at two Jesuit School, so he had an excellent traditional education. He was very much interested in philosophy and literature, modern languages, and he was especially interested in Italian, french and Norwegian, but through his life he acquired a knowledge of *18 languages*.
He wanted to study Norwegian because he wanted to read **Ibsen**

While he was a university student he decided to abandon catholic religion, and he developed the qualities of intellectual arrogance and intellectual **isolation** and pride. He was gifted with an exceptional memory, and a subtle intelligence, but he was physically weak, with weak eyes.

In October 1902 he graduated from university and he went to Paris to study medicine. He soon gave up and he returned to Dublin because his mother was dying. In that occasion he met Nora Barnacle who would later became his wife.
They married the 16 of June 1904 (The day Ulysses is settled).

The choice of leaving Dublin was the symbol of his rebellion to Ireland, and to being irish.

1. He rebelled against the Catholic Church, whose influence he saw as a limitation of his intellectual freedom.
2. He rebelled against Irish politics which he considered as a narrow [ristretto, angusto] provincial nationalism, while he believed in **cosmopolitan** ideal (or European).
3. He rebelled against Irish culture, which was according to him narrow and confining.
4. He rebelled against families ties, which were restrictive and inhibiting to his freedom.

After short stays in London, Paris and Zurich, in 1905 he settled in **Trieste** and he stayed there for 10 years.
Here he suffered extreme poverty, and 2 children were born there.

He always had great difficulties in publishing his books, but in the end, in 1914 he was able to publish *Dubliners*.
He then move to Zurich, and also in Zurich he suffered extreme poverty, and he had several operation at the eyes.

In 1916 he succeeded in publish *Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man*, and finally in 1922 his masterpiece *Ulysses* got published, and finally achieved financial security.

From 1922 to 1941 (when he died), he dedicated to *Finnegan wake*, that is too difficult to go through, because it is written in different languages, and also dream languages.

He is one of the towering figures of modern literature. If Eliot was the central figure in modernist poetry, Joyce was the greatest genius in modernist prose.

He was a great experimenter, and he introduces the techniques of the stream of consciousness in the english novel.

His fundamental aim was to represents the human conditions as a universal and objective reality.
His concerns extended to mankind, and not only to his times.

Joyce was born in Dublin, but he spend most of his adult life abroad. He went on a sort of volountary exile, because he found people living in Ireland as narrow-minded, and he found the cultural atmosphere in Ireland as stagnant.
Ireland was to tied to the past, according to Joyce.

To him, Dublin was the centre of paralysis, and he chose this city for his book _Dubliners_.
It was the centre for all his fictional universe.

Critics agree that Joyce has made Dublin the capital of literary cities in the 20th century. Joyce turned Dublin into a microcosm of the whole universe. Dublin stands for the whole universe.

## *Dubliners*

Dubliners is a collection of 15 short stories and the subject is the **decay and banality** of Dublin life.
They are **psychologically realistic sketches of urban life**, describing its atmosphere of disintegration with casual details, with charity and sympathy.

He published it in 1914, but he finish writing this stories in 1907: he took him 7 years to get his book published.
It's a collection of fifteen stories, which are arranged in thematic sequence: we can distinguish four section, each one represents one stage in life: **childhood** (the *Sister*), **adolescence** (*Eveling*), **maturity** (*Clay*) and **public life** (*the Dead*)

Very little happens in this stories, and Dublin is the **center of a paralysis**.
**Paralysis** is an important word, and this is the thematic word of the first story: *The syster*, and it indicates and intellectual, moral and spiritual paralysis, that derives from the accumulated failures of the disappointed lives of the frustrated people in Dublin.
The main themes of Joyces work are:

- Theme of the **city**
- Theme of the **artist**

### Theme of the city

Dublin is a special city, the only one in which Joyce is a citizen, because al the others are only places of exile.
It’s a city particular appropriate to him, and it is metropolitan and provincial at the same time.

### Theme of the artist

The modern artist is isolated from the community, and he rejects his environment.

### The language

Joyce uses the language that each character would have used, so he tries to adhere to the characters, and he describes the precise quality of their lives, using a style that is impersonal in appearance and economic and synthetic in its use of description.

Sensations, emotions and  ironical observations are rarely described at length [not in details], and language is mainly evocative.
James’s prose is extremely varied; for example the first story begins with a long passage written in simple language of a child, and then develops with an alternation of passages written in a style which is appropriate to the child’s aunt or the child himself, or the priest sister.

Joyce’s ability lies in writing lifelike dialogues and in reproducing the rhythm of irish speech.

### Common elements

There are some common elements in Dubliners:

1. The setting is **the city of Dublin**, which is both realistically individualised, with its streets, places, people, and made universal as the symbol of the modern metropolis, where human life is loosing its natural quality.
2. The main theme of all the stories is the same, which is the **failure to find a way out of paralysis**, which is the mental condition of people living in metropolis.
3. There is always an **epiphany**, which is the sudden revelation of an emblematic truth through a dialogue or through the description of an usual situation or a common object. [sorta di illuminazione]
4. **Narrator’s attitude** of compassionate irony and of friendly pity, through words of the protagonists of the story, who are never judged from a superior position. James Joyce abandons both the omniscience of the 19th century narrator and also the single point of view. So the story are told in the words of a character and from the perspective of a character.

---

### *The sisters*

The story starts *in medias res*. The child is speaking, and he is relating the death of priest, but as he is a child he is not sure that he priest has really died.
He will get sure when a visitor on his house came and announces the death of the priest.
But the child tries to hide his feeling and his sensations to his relatives. According to all the cotters the child should play with other children, The child hates all the cotters because they intrudes with comments in his life.
The child hates Old Cotter because he is a drunkard and because he spit in the fireplace. He feels hatred for Old Cotter.

After he goes to sleep he has a dream, since he was moved by the news of the death, and so he dreams of the priest

The reaction of the boy at the certainties (just through the note on the window) of the death is relief: he feels relieved and free.
So we get to know that there is a problem in the relationship between the child and the priest. This is an hint that there is something morbid and strange in their relationship.
We will get to know that there is something, but it is never expressed explicitly.

There are four characters involved:

- The boy (who is the narrator)
- His aunt
- Old Cotter
- Eliza (the sister who explains)

The situation is that the young boy gets to know that his former teacher of Latin and religious has died because of his third stroke.
The problem is that the boy is no unhappy, but instead he feels relieved and free.
There is a problem of pedophilia, which is only hinted and never made explicit. It’s told only his relief on priest’s death.

Old Cotter tells the child and relatives that the priest is died, but the child is still uncertain: he will go to the shop, and just after seeing the note on the glass he will be finally relieved

After this relief he went to bed, and dreamed about the Priest, and talk about paralysis.
He receives a confession from the priest, and the child feel like he is moving into a pleasant but vicious region. He confess his pedophilia and while doing it he smiles, with his lips wet of saliva. Then the child remember he is dead, and the child himself smiles, and this smile absolve the priest and his simony (sin of buying and selling religious privileges).
All this is not written explicitly.

James Joyce created a new way of writing: ==writer abdicates from is role and only characters are speaking==. He writes in the age of anxiety with Virginia Woolf. In fact here he tells the story from child’s point of view, and so he exaggerated all because of it.

The priest description (that came from the past life of the child from the priest) connotes him as shabby, sick, disgusting, sloppy, improper, filthy.

The child feels annoyed from relief he feels about the death of the priest. He feels annoyed because of the sense of guilt imposed by the church.

His relatives haven’t understood what was going on, and tells the child to feel sad because the priest was a good teacher. They list what he had taught to the child.

The priest is described through disgusting details about his physical appearance that show his lust. An example of many strange priest’s attitudes is:

> he used to smile pensively and nod his head, now and then pushing huge pinches of snuff up each nostril alternately. When he smiled he used to uncover his big discoloured teeth and let his tongue lie upon his lower lip—a habit which had made me feel uneasy in the beginning of our acquaintance before I knew him well.

The novel is divided into two parts, and between part 1 and 2 there is a **caesura**, which is when the child says what the priest had taught to him.
In the second part two characters are introduces, who are

1. **Nannie**, which is the diminutive of Anne (and also means “bambinaia”): she is the latter priest’s sister
2. **Father O’Rdurke**: he prepares the priest at all

Through the story we get to know that the protagonist is a child through some details:

- he enters the room on tiptoe, which is very childish
- he pretend to pray
- he tries to catch every detail, to be sure the priest is dead
- he declines food in order not to do noises

The priest was a **disappointed person**, a **failure**: he could have had a great career, but he didn’t exploit the position.

From the story that Eliza makes we get to know that the priest was disappointing for the two sisters: they expected him to became rich and successful.
On the contrary they praise Father O’Rourke as perfect, because he is clever, organized and powerful: he will probably make a career within the Church

The sister then talks about the only dream the priests had (which is with the sisters): we get to know that the priest has narrow perspective, he is simple-minded, since his only dream was to go and visit the house where he and his sisters were born.
During her speech she makes mistakes; her mastery of the language is quite limited: she is simple-minded and ignorant. Joyce is very good at reproducing this incorrect language.

Then there is the **epiphany**: the break of the chalice.
After this he began to mope by himself.
The chalice is the symbol of the choice of religious life, because in the chalice there is the transubstantiation; moreover it is particularly valuable, made in gold and decorated with jewels. So breaking it is the symbol of breaking the religious choice he did.

Maybe the breaking of the chalice represents also the denial of the promise made to God concerning the abstinence from sex.
James Flynn hasn’t respected his promise of chastity.

This act is the symbol of breaking the choice of his life: he realizes he is a disappointing life. The fall represents the complete failure of his life.

James Joyce was very critic against the Catholic Church. He resented the sense of guilt that the Jesuits had instilled in him.

### *Eveline*

The second story is the story connected to the period of adolescence. In fact Eveline is 19yo. She is an Irish girl, whose situation is quite bad for many reasons:

1. Her mother died prematurely of cancer.
2. Her father is a drunkard, he is violent, possessive, brutal and mean [avaro].
3. She is in charge of the house, so she is expected to do the cleaning and tidying.
4. She is also expected to look after her younger brother.
5. She works in a shop and the shop-owner ill treats her. She scolds her when the shop is crowded.
6. She has two elder brothers, but one is away for work and the other is dead.

All in all her life is very hard.
She has an opportunity of improving her life, by leaving Ireland with her boyfriend Frank.

#### First Part

Frank has proposed to go together to Buenos Aires. She is deciding what to do. The moment is topic because she has to choose whether to go or to stay.

The story take place at sunset, which is the moment of melancholy and meditation during the day. During the narration there is a sense of melancholy.
She uses the form *used to*, to describe habits in the past that aren’t so anymore.

Her father is introduced as a violent character.

We get to know from the very beginning that she will not go with Frank, because she is already looking for alibis, that justify her to stay, although the situation is very bad: she doesn’t have the strength to go.
She is looking at her house with the eyes of a person who is forced to leave: she feels desolate and she is repenting.

The reasons not to go are:

- She was surrounded by people she knew.
- In her house she had shelter and food.

She describes the fact that she has to give all her money to her father, and she feels in danger.
We get to know that are the two sons to support the family.

She was overwhelmed by all his due.

Then she talks about Frank. He is

- Kind
- Manly
- Open-hearted
- Suntanned, he has a dark complexion
- Cheerful
- Involved

Her father had forbidden her to meet Frank, so they had to meet secretly.

#### Second part

The second part is the part which prepares to the **epiphany**.
There is a turning point: *the evening deepened in the avenue*.

She had written 2 letters, to her brother and to her father.
So far she has been piling alibis not to go away, finding excuses.

Now she find a new excuses: her father will miss her. She remembers **two** occasions in her life when her father had been kind to her.

1. She was ill and her father had toasted [brindato] with her
2. They had been going on a trip and he had wore his wife’s bonnet to entertain the children.

Then the epiphany is starting when the sound of a barrel-organ, which play a song that reminds her of her mother, and the promise she made to her to keep the family together.
She remembers also the death of her mother.

The reasons not to go now are four:

1. She knows everything at home
2. She has shelter and food
3. Her father is getting old and will need and miss her
4. She had promised to her mother to keep the family together and care about the children.

#### Final part

Then she gathers the strength to leave.

The final part is very sad, she has meditated and she has listed all the reasons to stay, then she has a sudden impulse to go to the docks [porto] (she hasn’t decided yet), and at the docks she experiences her **epiphany**.

*The boat blew a long ==mournful== whistle into the mist*
This is an anticipation.

She decides to stay, triggered by the **mournful** whistle.

She realises she is losing something vital to her, the only chance to fulfil her life.
She is paralysed by the fear of the unknown, and she realises she will always be a slave and a loser.

The story reminds us of Nora Barnacle, who was Joyce’s wife, who left Ireland with him

#### *Clay*

When in Great Britain you are christened the priest says “you are clay” [Tu sei polvere e polvere ritornerai]
The difference between **clay** and **dust** is that dust flies, while clay is wet.

Clay is the material used to make bricks, but it also mean mud and earth in general. It’s a reference to the mortal body of man. So there is an anticipation of death

The protagonist’s name is **Maria**, which is pronounced “Meraia”.
The Black Maria was a van used to transport prisoners to the scaffold.

Maria is middle aged and horrible.

- She had a long nose, so that when she laughs her nose and chin touched.
- She is a spinster [zitella]
- she works in a laundry and she is a cook.
- She is very much appreciated because of her **nice character** and personality. Her companion say she is a peacemaker

Her problem is that she has a goal in her life, which is to **get married**. She still haven’t lost hopes.
Instead there are few possibilities, because she is unattractive and she works with only women.

The story is centered on the sterility and humility of **celibacy**.
The protagonist ignore vital impulses: she is probably a **maiden** [virgin] and she is quit unaware and unskilled, but she still hopes and she thinks that her life will be fulfilled by the meeting of a men.

Her companion had understood this, and they gently mock her. She is disappointed by these mocks, she feels upset.
A woman say she wants a **ring** (*first reference to ring*). She always tells lies about this, saying she didn’t need a man.

She is going to visit one of the two br other (**Joe** and **Alfie**) whom she looked after when she was young.

- The two brothers had fallen out.
- They were very close to her.
- They also helped her to find a job

While getting ready to go out she still find herself attractive.
She gets the bus and then she go to the *confectioner’s*.

Here there is the second reference to the ring and marriage. The owner, in fact, since she was spending too much time in choosing a plum-cake into the confectioner’s, asks whether she was going to chose her **wedding cake**. She *blushes*.

On the tram she meet a **gentleman**, who talk with her. She was so excited to have talked to a man that she forget her plum-cakes. But in reality the man had talked to her just because *he was tipsy* [brillo].

When she gets her guests house, she realizes she lost her plum-cake.
We get to know that she isn’t so good as person because when she realizes of the lost of plum-cake *she accused the children* instead of taking responsibility.

The children will take **revenge** on her.

Before the epiphany there is an attempt of Maria to bring Joe and Alfie together, but there is no possibility.

She is coaxed [blandita] to play; it’s a game in which you get to know what will be your future: she is blindfolded and lead to a table with saucers to chose from. They can choose from

- Ring
- Bible: you will became a nun or a priest
- Water: open destiny

The children instead **add clay**, which means death, as a revenge.

**Epiphany**: she chooses clay, but at a second attempt, made since an adult understood what was going on, she chooses the Bible. There is **no possibility** to her to get married, so either she will die or she will enter a convent.

Life tells her there is nothing for her, but **clay** and **the prayer book**. She realises her life of dream is over and it is like **Eveline**, but sadder.

However she doesn’t give up.
She had to sing a song, but she changes the words of the song and in the new words she dreams to have a lot of suitors [pretendenti]. No one tried to show her her mistake.

She is even more pitiful because she doesn’t accept reality and her destiny. She has just get to realise that her life is over but she can’t.

### *The Dead*

![Schermata 2021-05-30 alle 17.28.58](/assets/Schermata%202021-05-30%20alle%2017.28.58_6jfrf8yhw.png)
![Schermata 2021-05-30 alle 17.29.18](/assets/Schermata%202021-05-30%20alle%2017.29.18.png)

It is the last story and the longer one, and probably the most important story.
The setting is always Dublin, since he saw it as the center of **paralysis**. Dublin is considered by Joyce the center of paralysis. All his fifteen stories reflect this feeling of stagnation and decay that Joyce associated with Ireland and with the city of Dublin.
The Dead can be read as the climax of this cultural and social stagnation.

This is the longest story, the most complex one, but it is also the most important because it it here that we find one of Joyces first examples of **indirect interior monologue**, a technique that he would master in his later production.

The style is still traditional in the whole book, and it is realistic: he portrays Dublin in a realistic way, and this book is still traditional, but the narration is often interspersed with moments of intensity: **ephipany**

It is an acute analysis of Dublin's life. There are fifteen stories in this collection, the settin is Dublin because it is the center of paralysis.

All the protagonists of this story experience this sense of paralyses, because they are all tied to their antiquated social and cultural tradition. They are also inhibited by repressive moral codes

The Dead is the last story, and it is the climax of this feeling of stagnation that rounds trhough all the stories, that pervades all the stories.

Stilistically speaking Dubliners is still traditional, and it is characterized by a strong descriptive realism. It also includes some more innovative elements that will characterize his later production.
These innovative elements are

- absence of a moralizing narrator
- no presence of a onniscent narrator
- the stories are told trough the character's perspective, we follow their thoughts
- the story is often interspersed with moments of insights that Joyce calls ephipanies

In the final story, _the Dead_, Joyce goes beyond the earlier stories, because he produces a more compassionate view of the characters, there is a more intimate study of the characters and he moves away from the descriptive realism and from the objective presentation that characterize the rest of the book. This descriptive realism was the dominant approach in the rest of the book. In this last story, he partly abandons it, and he move towars a more intimate study of his characters.

In _the Dead_ we also find one of his first fully realized example of the interior monologue: it is used to reproduce the stream of consciousness that takes place in a persons mind.

_The Dead_ can be divided into two different sections:

- in the first section the protagonist, Gabriel Conroy, is at a dinner party
- in the second section we find a sort of musical coda, which contains the protagonist's reflections and meditation on what happened at the pary.

#### First section

The protagonist has two aunts, Julia and Kate Mokran, they are two elderly unmarried women, and they have the tradition of organizing a party every year during the christmas holidays, in which they invite all their family members and their friends, and so this is the occasion.

This party is held shortly after christmas, and this gathering is an occasion for Joyce to make a portrait of Dublin: there are people of different generation, there are people with different religion believes, and there are also different political simpaties. He makes a portrait of Dublin as the heart of modern Ireland, but more generally speaking Dublin becomes the heart of modern society.
He presents a microcosm that stands for modern society.

The high point of this party is a speech that Gabriel makes in front of everybody, and he is applauded by everyone, and so he feels exaltant, he is filled with self-love and self-satisfaction, he feels important.
The reals central event of the party is Gretta's Ephipany; she is Gabriel's wife, and she is also present at the party: during the party she hears an old irish song, and when she ears it she is on the stairs, and so she's paralysed on these stairs, as if time stopped for her, because that song reminded her of Michael Furey, her first love, and probably her only true love; she steps out of time and she goes back to her youth.

During Gretta's auditory ephipany there is also Gabriel's visual ephipany, that happen at the same time.
She stops on the stairs, and Gabriel looks at his life from the bottom of the stairs: she is like the figure of a painting, and this is probably the first time that he took some time to look at his wife in her whole appearance.

After the party they go to a near by Hotel, and during this walk Gabriel feels phisical desire for his wife, he remembers their courtship and their premarried life and all the happy moments of their married life. He is fillled with physical desire for his wife.

As soon as they reach the intimacy of the hotel bedroom, to his great astonishment, he discovers that his wife is crying, because she is thinking about Michael Feury.
She explains him that during the party she had heard an old irish song, that had took her to her youth, and she tells him about Michael Furey, a boy who died for her when he was only seventeen; actually he died of pneumonia, but he contracted pneumonia after spending long ours in front of her house when it was snowing.

After this painfull memory Gretta falls asleep, because she is overwhelmed by the intensity of these past feelings.

#### Second section

Here there are Gabriel's thoughts when his wife is sleeping. The setting loses any temporal connotation, since in Gabriel's thoughts past, present and future intermingle. He looks at his wife and he realizes that she is no longer the pretty girl that Micheal Furey had fallen in love with, he thinks about Michael Furey, he thinks about the past, and he realies that he played a poor part in his wife's life: their relationship was emotional insipide in comparison to her love affair with Micheal Furey

He understand that it is better to live a short life, but full of emotions and passion, than living a longer life which is passionless. Living a life in which everything fades away and there is nothing memorable to look back on.

He thinks about the future, because he imagines the funeral of one of his aunts. He makes some other reflection on death.

He feels the noise of the snow which is tapping on the windopane. He looks out of the window and the story ends with him looking at the snow which is covering the city of Dublin.

When Gabriel looked at the snow he experienced another epiphany. He meditates upon the intimate insignificance of even the most intense moments of life. The snow becomes a powerful symbol which can be interpretive in many different ways:

- **purity**: because of its colour (white) it can be seen as a symbol of purity; it seems to clear everything;
- **death**: it can also be read as a symbol of death. The snow falls upon the living and the dead, making everything indistinguishable It bares everything and the city becomes a cemetery; death is like a great leveller because when we died, we are all equal and it does not matter if someone has been poor or rich during life; the snow dissolves itself when it melts, another link to death;
- **paralysis**: it can be also seen as a symbol of paralysis because everything seems dead; the reader has the impression that the living characters are actually spiritually dead, to the point that they are more dead than Michael Fury, he’s physically dead, but alive in Greta’s heart.

It is in Joyce symbolism that we see it’s experimentation with the language. In his symbolism he experiments, it’s very innovative, whereas his realism is traditional.
We have the symbolism of the snow and than the symbolism of the names of the characters. In the extract, Gabriel and Michael are highlighted in pink. Gabriel is the name of the angel that plays the trumpet of the last judgment, Michael is also the name of an angel.
At a certain point he thinks about going “westward”, which is also a symbol. “going west word” is an idiomatic expression, it means dying. This expression makes us identify Gabriel with Joyce himself, we have the idea that Gabriel represents what Joyce would have become if he hadn’t left Ireland.

- The expressions underlined in blu, presents some examples of Joyce realistic descriptions.
- Those highlighted in light blue includes Gabriel thoughts expressed in past continuous or past simple, and represents the present of the narration.
- Those highlighted in green, includes Gabriel thoughts expressed in past perfect, this represent the past of the narration.
- Highlighted in yellow are those Gabriel’s expressions referred to the future of the narration.
- The grey arrows are lines that includes a passage from an outer reality to an inner reality.
- The red dots indicate moments of epiphany

## _A Portrait of the Artist as a young man_

In his literary production Joyce brought this city to life again and again. Dublin isn't the setting only of _Dubliners_, but also of _A Portrait of the Artist as a young man_, which is his first novel, published in 1916. By the time Joyce came to write this novel, he had been away from Dublin for 10 years.

This prolonged temporal and geographical distance influence his method of evoking Dublin: in _Dubliners_ the city emerges as a concrete urban landscape, instead in _A Portrait of the Artist as a young man_ Dublin is filtered through the protagonist's consciousness; Dublin is no longer out there in the world, but it is inside the protagonist's imagination.

Here the **style** is less realistic that in Dubliners.

This novel deals with the spiritual development of a young man, and for this reason we can read this as a novel of education (or a Bildungsroman) [romanzo di formazione].

The protagonist is a Young irish writer, who is in search of experience and success.

The protagonist is internally divided between the standards of an ascetic religious upbringing and his desire for sensuousness.

This can be read as a novel of education, but this novel also appears to be very **autobiographical**.

In its depiction of the protagonist's childhood, adolescence, and gradual growth into a modern artist, this novel appears to be heavily autobiographical.
_A Portrait of the Artists as a young man_ is actually a Joyce's portrait. The protagonist is Joyce's fictional projection of himself.

The hero, Stephen Dedalus has many ==traits in common with the author==:

- he is the son of a poor father, as Joyce
- Stephen's mother is a fervent catholic woman, like Joyce's own mother
- Like Joyce, Stephen attend jesuit school
- Like Joyce, Stephen goes on a voluntary exile in Paris
The novel is mostly played in Dublin, but at the end the setting in place changes to Paris.
- Stephen rejected his people, his nation and his religion, to find fulfillment as a **martyr artist**, as Joyce
The protagonist name can be read as a symbol of a martyr artist:
  - Stephen remind us of **Saint Stephen**, the first martyr of christianity, who was accused of blasphemy, and he was stoned to death, because he was preaching a new religion; Stephen thinks of himself as a victim of incomprehention in his own land;
  - **Dedalus** is a mithological character, he was an artist and a skillful craftsman: he built the labyrinth for King Minos, and then he was imprisoned by the king within the labyrinth; Dedalus was able to escape from the labyrinth by creating two wax wings; Stephen Dedalus decided to leave Ireland on the winds of their own art.

Joyce preserved a cool detachment from his character.

Stephen lives in an ordinary, trivial and banal environment, which is too much in contrast with its inner aspirations.

At the end of the novel, Stephen experiences what the author call an **epiphany**: it's a moment of revelation, which enabled him to discover his true task in becoming an artist.
Becoming an artist is the only way to go beyond the mediocrity surrounding him, and it's the only way to achieve the deepest meaning of life.

The development of Stephen's consciousness is interesting since although it's described with a great objectivity it gives us an insight of the influences and the tensions that shaped Joyce's own mind.

In this novel through the character of Stephen, Joyce is able to insert a **programmatic manifesto** on what he sees as the **role of the modernist writer**.
In this novel Stephen work out a theory, according to which the artist is like the God of creation, that _remains within or behind or beyond or above his work_, invisible, refined out of existence and indifferent.

This is a view of art that implies **objectivity** and impersonality, even the exile of the artist, even though the artist actually uses material provided by his own life. The artist should not express his view point.
This idea of impersonality was present also in Eliot.

### Style

The novel begins with a third person narrator, and then it switches to a first person narrator. This first person narrator obviously further catapults us into ==Stephen's mind==.

The most famous aspect's of this novel is Joyce's innovative use of the **stream of consciousness**.
Through this technique the writer almost disappears, and the readers find themselves directly inside a character's mind.

Rather then describing character's sensations, feelings and thoughts from an external point of view, the stream of consciousness allows the author to directly transcribe the thoughts and the sensations that go through the character's mind.

Joyce develops the **language** from what it's appropriate to the small child of the first pages, to the articulate comments on art made by a university student, which is Stephen at the end of the novel.
The language changes through the novel, according to the protagonist growth.

It's peculiar the presence of **peaks of intensity** in the narration, that Joyce calls ==epiphanies==.
He explains what an epiphany is in a first draft of this novel: it's a sudden revelation in which the soul of the commonest object seems to us radiant.
It is a sudden spiritual awakening, when ordinary thoughts and feelings come together to produce a new awareness.

An epiphany is usually associated to an external element, which can be an object, a sound, a music, a sight of something, that triggers a new awareness.

### Structure

The novel is made up of five chapters, that follow chronologically Stephen life from childhood through adolescence until the age of 20.

The novel is mainly settled in Dublin, which is largely populated bu characters who closely resemble Joyce's family members, friends and enemies.

During the novel the protagonist go through a series of crucial transformations:

1. in the ==first part of the novel==, Stephen is a shy little boy, but at school he proves to be a **brilliant student**;
2. Stephen is leaved with a **prostitute**, and this is the protagonist's transition from innocence to corruption;
3. Stephen, from a sinner, decide to become a **fervent catholic**;
4. in the ==fourth chapter== there is the most important, when Stephen rejects his religiousness, to a new devotion to **art and beauty**; this transformation is reinforced in the last chapter, when he is finally an artist.

### T: *Where was his boyhood now?*

![Schermata 2021-05-30 alle 17.26.44](/assets/Schermata%202021-05-30%20alle%2017.26.44.png)![Schermata 2021-05-30 alle 17.27.21](/assets/Schermata%202021-05-30%20alle%2017.27.21_3v5pj2839.png)

The setting is a shore: Stephen is looking at the sea in front of him, he is looking at the sky and at the water, and he’s admiring this beautiful wild scenery.

There is very little action in the usual sense of the term, because here Joyce is more interested in Stephen’s emotions.

At the beginning Stephen is alone, and then he ears some childish voices: when he ear some children playing on the beach, he suddenly realises that his boyhood is over.

Then he notices a girl, and there is this beautiful description of the girl (**from line 25 to 30**), which gives an idea of elegance, purity, freedom, softness, purity, chastity.
This girl embodies these concepts.

When Stephen looks at the girl, he experiences an **epiphany**; he feels very excited and in this moment he expresses his wish to break free from all the constriction imposed by the Catholic Church and by the town of Dublin.

There are some negative expression related to his boyhood:

- **line 1**: *the grave of boyhood* linked to *grave clothes*
- **line 18**: _house of squalor_

These images convey the squalor of Stephen’s life.

#### Style

There is a third person narrator, while the POV is Stephen’s.

The language is Stephen’s language, and in order to reproduce Stephen’s thoughts Joyce uses different expression, and **free direct speech**:

- **line 1**: *Yes! Yes! Yes!*
- **line 6**: *On! On!*
- **lines 17-19**: *Where was... was he?*
- **line 43-44**: *To live... out of life*: this sentence reflects Stephen’s artistic creed
- **line 46**: *On and... and on!*

## *Ulysses*

It was published in 1922 and this work marks a turning point in his career because his career can be generally divided in 2 different periods:

- **First period** is characterised by a traditional approach and the most significant work of the first period is *Dubliners*; we can also includes *A portrait of the artist of a Young man*. The plot is still quite linear and the syntax is still quite logical. The language reflects everyday language.
- **Second period**: it begins with *Ulysses* because it is a linguistic experiment. It was banned in Britain and American when it was published because it was considered too complex and incomprehensible. After *Ulysses* he dedicated his life to an even more complex work, *Finnegans Wakes* because he wanted to keep the literary historians busy for the next 400 years.

What changes between the periods is only the language because the setting is Dublin for both of them.

*Ulysses* takes as its material a single day, 16th June 1904,, the protagonists are two men and a woman, and the work is divided into three different sections, each one is dedicated to one of the central characters:

- **first section**: it is dedicated to Stephen Dedalus. “Steven” is the name of the first Christian martyr because we was accused of preaching a new religion. Also Stephen is treating badly by the Irish because tried to have a different approach to life. He is a craftsman (artigiano). Stephen has intellectual ambitions.
- **second section**: is about Leopold Bloom and he is an advertisement sales man. This morning he steps out of his house and starts wandering through the streets of Dublin and then he bumps into Stephen. They went into a brothel where they got drunk. Stephen had been evicted (sfrattato) from his house, so Leopold offers to take him into his house: so Leopold become a sort of protector father for Stephen. Leopold Bloom stands for Ulysses and Stephen stands for Telemachus.
- **third section**: it is focused on Leopold wife Molly Bloom which stands for Penelope (Ulysse’s wife). The difference is that Penelope was faithful to her husband while Leopold wife isn’t. While Leopold walks around the streets of Dublin, she spends time with another man.

This works wants to reproduce the classical one (made by Homer) and in fact Joyce Ulysses is structured in 18 episodes which parallel the same episodes that we find in Homers’ Odyssey even though in Joyce’s works we do not find the same order of Homer’s work.
This parallelism has got comic and parodic connotation because Joyce wants to show that modern men faces the same tragedies, triumphs, conflicts and problems of the classical heroes; the difference is that a modern man is no hero and he cannot rely on the God to help him through his struggles.

Ulysses is made up of 18 episodes, which are meant to reproduce similar episodes in Homer's text. The order in which these episodes are arranged is different from the classical text. Joyce wanted to demonstrate that the problems and the conflicts faced by modern man are the same problems and conflicts faced by men in classical times.

The difference is that the modern man is an anti-hero, cannot rely on the kindness of God;
it is exactly this ordinariness that made Leopold Bloom such a vital character: he is much more vital than Homer's Ulysses. Leopold Bloom, who stands for every man, contains a death and a vitality that no classical hero posseses.

Ulysses represents an high point of modernism, and this novel is full of examples of **interior monologue**. In this novel the reader follows the internal voyages of the character's mind, so the reader swims in the sea of thoughts and feelings of the characters. Joyce is brilliant in reproducing the workings of the mind. He adopt a very difficult language, since there is no punctuation, there are no connectors, the syntax is disjointed; there are often missing elements in a sentence. Reading Ulysses is like wearing earphones which are plugged into someone's brain.

An other reason for its complexity is the presence of different quotations or allusions to the whole of western literature and culture. This is a feature that we also found in Eliot. There's plenty of allusion, quotations, that refers to western literature and culture, that makes the text very complex. As we saw in Eliot there can be different levels of reading, according to how many references the reader is able to notice.
This novel is a sort of enciclopedic novel for its many allusions and quotations. This novel has been defined by some a "telephone directory" [guida telefonica] because many critics found that this novel could be read from the beginning to its end, but also from its and to the beginning; there is no logical linear sequence.

It is a very complex novel, in which we find one of Joyce's best example of literary technique.

### *Extract*

> he said I was a flower of the mountain ye so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a woman is and I knew I could always get round him and I gave him all the pleasure I could  leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was thinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and Hester and father and old captain Groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and I say stoop and washing up the dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the Greeks and the Jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and turbens like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and Ronda with the old windows or the posadas glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown torrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all the queer little street and pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where I was a flower of the mountains yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breast all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad yes I said yes I will Yes.’

Traduzione:

> disse che ero un fior di montagna / sì siamo tutti fiori / allora un corpo di donna / sì è stata una delle poche cose giuste che ha detto in vita sua / e il sole splende per te oggi / sì perciò mi piacque / sì perché vidi che capiva o almeno sentiva cos’è una donna / e io sapevo che me lo sarei rigirato come volevo / e gli detti quanto più piacere potevo per portarlo a quel punto / finché non mi chiese di dir di sì / e io dapprincipio non volevo rispondere / guardavo solo in giro il cielo e il mare / pensavo a tante cose che lui non sapeva / di Mulveyl e Mr Stanhope e Hester e papà e il vecchio capitano Groves / e i marinai che giocavano al piattello e alla cavallina come dicevan loro sul molo / e la sentinella davanti alla casa del governatore con quella cosa attorno all’elmetto bianco / povero diavolo mezzo arrostito / e le ragazze spagnole che ridevano nei loro scialli / e quei pettini alti / e le aste la mattina i Greci e gli ebrei e gli Arabi e il diavolo chi sa altro da tutte le parti d’Europa / e Duke street e il mercato del pollame / un gran pigolio davanti a Larby Sharonl / e i poveri ciuchini che inciampavano mezzi addormentati / e gli uomini avvolti nei loro mantelli / addormentati all’ombra sugli scalini / e le grandi ruote dei carri dei tori / e il vecchio castello vecchio di mill’anni / sì e quei bei Mori tutti in bianco / e turbanti come re / che ti chiedevano di metterti a sedere in quei loro buchi di botteghe / e Ronda con le vecchie finestre delle posadas / fulgidi occhi celava l’inferriata / perché il suo amante baciasse le sbarre / e le gargotte mezzo aperte la notte / e le nacchere / e la notte che perdemmo il battello ad Algesiras / il sereno che faceva il suo giro con la sua lampada / e Oh quel pauroso torrente laggiù in fondo / Oh e il mare / il mare qualche volta cremisi come il fuoco / e gli splendidi tramonti / e i fichi nei giardini dell’Alameda / sì e tutte quelle stradine curiose / e le case rosa e azzurre e gialle / e i roseti e i gelsomini e i geranii e i cactus / e Gibilterra da ragazza dov’ero un Fior di montagna / sì quando mi misi la rosa nei capelli / come facevano le ragazze andaluse / o ne porterò una rossa / sì / e come mi baciò sotto il muro moresco / e io pensavo be’ lui ne vale un altro / e poi gli chiesi con gli occhi di chiedere ancora / sì allora mi chiese se io volevo / sì dire di sì / mio fior di montagna / e per prima cosa gli misi le braccia intorno / sì e me lo tirai addosso / in modo che mi potesse sentire il petto tutto profumato / sì e il suo cuore batteva come impazzito / e sì dissi / sì voglio / sì.

It is taken from Molly Bloom famous monologue which ends Ulysses. This is a **direct interior monologue** (in the indirect interior monologue there is the guide of a narrator). There is no a narrator, and so it is more difficult to read. The thoughts are directly presented as they come in a character's mind.

Molly is at home, in bed, and she start thinking about her youth, she recalls the first encounter whit Leopold Bloom, and then the extracts end with her memory of Leopold Bloom marriage proposal.
The final words are

> Yes, I will, Yes

which refers to the marriage proposal

There are no signs of punctuation. It is difficult to go trough molly's thougts, since we don't know much about her past life, and so she jumps to one memory to one other, and then she thinks about the future; there is a difference of temporal planes.
Joyce basically doesn't select material on an estetic ground, but he preserves all the rubbish that passes through a character's mind.

# Jane Austen

## Life

Jane Austen was born in 1775 in Steventon, Hampshire, in a small village in southern England where her father was rector of the church. The seventh of eight children, she spent her short, uneventful life within the circle of her very close, affectionate family. Her lifelong, inseparable companion was her sister Cassandra, who, like Jane, never married. She was educated at home by her father, and showed an interest in literature and writing very early. Her earliest writings in fact date from 1787. She then produced a large output of prose and, between 1975 and 1797, she completed _Elinor and Marianne_, which would become the basis of _Sense and Sensibility_, published in 1811, and _First Impressions_, which, later revised, became _Pride and Prejudice_, published in 1813. In 1798 she wrote _Northanger Abbey_, which was published posthumously. When her father died, Jane, her sister and mother settled at Chawton, a small country village a few miles from her birthplace. There Jane produced her most mature works: _Mansfield Park_, begun in 1811 and published in 1814; _Emma_, begun in 1814 and published in 1816; _Persuasion_, begun in 1815 and published in 1818, after her death. She died probably of Addison's disease in Winchester in 1817, and was buried in Winchester Cathedral. All her novels were published anonimously; her her identity was later revealed by her brother Henry who supervised the publication of _Northanger Abbey_ and _Persuasion_, adding a 'Biographica Notice of the Author'. Jane's fame, however, was already well estabilished: among her contemporaries, Sir Walter Scott was one of the first to realise her greatness in his review of _Emma_, where he pointed out her 'exquisite touch which renders ordinary common place things and characters'.

She is an unusual writer in the romantic period, because she wrote novels in a period when poetry was very popular. She wrote six novels.
Because of this and many other choices she made she is considered anti-romantic.

==Why is she anti-romantic?==

1. She wrote novels
2. She was no interested in historical events
3. She didn’t take part in literally circles
4. She didn’t care about social problems (as all romantics did)
5. She focuses on a class and a reality that she used to know very well: the **upper-middle class**. The world of her novels is restricted to provincial England. Critics had said that she lacked an overall vision of the historical and social events

==Why can we say she is a great writer?==

Because we still read her novels with great pleasure.
The strength of her novels appears in the following elements:

1. With her **penetrating inside** she recreates the triviality of **everyday life**. Made up of _dinners_, _dances_, _excursions_, _balls_, which she turns into opportunities to gather and study a large range of characters
2. **Characterisation**: she is very good at creating living characters from the kind of people she knew:
    - Landed gentry
    - Country clergy
    - Middle classes
 Her characters are reasonable creatures who are not given to violent inner conflicts, nor to fierce passions.
3. **Objectivity**: she seldom intrudes in her novels with comments or judgements. When she does so it’s generally in a delicate almost impersonal way, which makes her presence unobtrusive.
4. **Intensity of observation**: She is capable of observation but also of detachment, so she describes her characters with a scientific eye, neither sparing their faults, nor idealizing them.
5. **Profound psychological study**: her main subjects are _courtship_ and _marriage_. By dealing with them she shows the restrictions of the woman’s position in the 18th and 19th centuries, in which an unmarried woman was destined to the dull life of nursing elderly parents or relatives or looking after her relatives children.
6. **Lack of sentimentality**: feelings seem to be absent, or anyway well concealed under everyday rituals. At the core of everything there is marriage. Jane Austen doesn’t appreciate a marriage based on wealth or on a sudden violent passion. A good marriage is based on calm judgment and mutual understanding.
7. **Realism**: she never romances her stories, so she writes stories of domestic life, without heroes or adventures. She inherits the lesson Richardson’s novels, that are not so cheesy.
8. **Humor**: her sense of humor is subtle and unpredictable, and it is often made up of unexpected paradoxes.
9. **Satire**: She can be very mordant and witty, but she is never ruthless.
10. **Precise ad lucide style**, made up of
    - **dialogues** and conversations that are the main vehicle for the revelation of a character
    - **letter writing**, which is typical of the Augustian age, and rich in varied registers
    - **ironic wit**
    - **precise use of words**
    - **well structured** and **polished sentences**

## The novel of manners

The changes in the social hierarchy of English society in the 19th century provided the background for the rise of the novel of manners. Wealth and influence were passing from the aristocracy to the newly successful middle classes, so the standard markers for determining an individual’s position in society proved increasingly unreliable. The novel of manners dealt with how these classes behaved in everyday situations, and described their codes of conduct. The undisputed master of the novel of manners was Jane Austen, whose novels were based on the premise that there is a vital relationship between manners, social behaviour and character. They are usually set in the upper and middle levels of society, generally in the country with few insights into town life. They deal with the codes and conventions of daily behaviour through the description of visits, balls and teas as occasions for meeting. They explore personal relationships, class distinctions and deal with the influence of money and property on the way people treat each other. Their main themes are marriage and the complications of love and friendship. A third-person narrator is employed and dialogue plays a central role, especially as a vehicle for irony. Passions and emotions are not expressed directly but more subtly and obliquely.

## Marriage

Marriage is all important in Jane Austen’s novels. All her novels but for one deal with the theme of marriage.
Marriage was so important in this period because it granted a **social position** to women. If you didn’t marry your destiny would be looking after your relatives or looking after your relatives’ children, and it was quite frustrating.

According to Jane Austen ideal marriage is not based only on **physical attraction**, but on **mutual comprehension**, that should be reached after overcoming obstacles and clearing misunderstandings.
It took a long to a couple to **get together**.

The idea of marriage in _Pride and Prejudice_ is the one between Elizabeth and Darcy, while the one between Jane and Bingley, and especially between Elizabeth’s parents is far from perfect.

The traditional values of country families – such as property, decorum, money and marriage – provided the basis of the plots and settings of Jane Austen’s novels. They take place in England; there is no Scotland, Wales or Ireland and not even the industrial north of England. Jane Austen writes about the oldest England, based on the possession of land, parks and country houses; in her stories people from different counties get married as a result of the growing social mobility. The marriage market takes place in London, Bath and some seaside resorts where people used to gather and carry out their business. And it is in these places that all the troubles of Austen’s world occur: gossip, flirtations, seductions, adulteries. This happens because the marriage market has also produced a range of villains: unscrupulous relatives, seducers, gamblers and social climbers.

## Pride and Prejudice

### T: _Mr and Mrs Bennet_

- ==p. 317==

The wit that characterize Jane Austen is clear from the very first sentence.
The novel starts with a sort of epigram [frase ad effetto] which make we realize how clever the writer is.

> It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
>
> However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
>
> "My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"
>
> Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
>
> "But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."
>
> Mr. Bennet made no answer.
>
> "Do not you want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
>
> "You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
>
> This was invitation enough.
>
> "Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."
>
> "What is his name?"
>
> "Bingley."
>
> "Is he married or single?"
>
> "Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
>
> "How so? how can it affect them?"
>
> "My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
>
> "Is that his design in settling here?"
>
> "Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."
>
> "I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party."
>
> "My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
>
>"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
>
>"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."
>
>"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
>
>"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new comers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."
>
>"You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
>
>"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."
>
>"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."
>
>"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
>
>"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least."
>
>"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
>
>"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
>
>"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not visit them.""Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all."
>
>Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. Her mind was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.

It is the introduction to the novel, and it anticipates some remarkable features of the novel.

We get to know that the main worry of upper middle class family who have daughters is marriage: **marriage** is the most important theme of the novel, and it is closely connected to **love**, **status** and **wealth**.
Marriage will be presented in the novel from several point of view.

* The marriage between Elizabeth’s best friend Charlotte and Mr Collins is based on security
* Instead an other point of view is the **infatuation**, which is the marriage between Lydia and Mr Wickham
* The marriage between Mr Bingley and Elizabeth is better because it is based on. **physical attraction** and **real love**: this is the perfect marriage according to Jane Austen: it is based on mutual comprehension.
* Mr and Mrs Bennet are quite peculiar, since their marriage was based on physical attraction, but through the time beauty became withered, and now there is nothing, since they are too different:
	* Mr Bennet dislikes his wife, he despises her; he is much more clever than his wife, and he belongs to a superior family; he left his wife educate their 5 daughter , and he has isolated from the family (he is a sort of misanthrope). He looks down to his wife and daughter. He has given up in their education because his wife is uncontrollable, and he appreciates only one of his daughter, which is **Elizabeth**.
	* Mrs Bennet on the other hand is superficial, simple minded, ignorant and moody. He cares only about social occasions and gossip.
	* This is an example of how a marriage should never be from the very beginning: it’s a way to demonstrate Austen’s thesis.

### T: _Mr Darcy Proposes to Elizabeth_

- ==p. 319==

The passage signs the lowest moment in the relationship between Darcy and Elizabeth: so far they have acted kindly to each other, but now instead they are very aggressive to each other.

While Elizabeth is visiting her best friend, she is visited by Mr Darcy, who unexpectedly proposes to her.

The first part underline Mr Darcy’s agitation and upsets.

Abruptly he make his proposal.
The first words are wrong, since he says that it was a struggle to make that proposal. Elizabeth, who already feels like she has to defend herself,  weights his words.

Elizabeth reaction is beyond expression: she is **silent**.

He lists the reasons why he shouldn’t have proposed
> His sense of her inferiority — of its being a degradation — of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to  recommend his suit.

There are three stages of her reaction:

* She feels sorry, because she will refuse him
* After that she feels resentful
* And then she becomes angry.

She get angrier and angrier when she realizes that he is sure she will accept.
> He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security.

Elizabeth is very clever and dignified, but also very prejudiced: the anger she has so far experienced deprives her of the possibility of thinking clearly.

The reasons for her negation are:

#### First reason

> His sense of her inferiority -- of its being a degradation -- of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination

#### Second Reason

The way the proposal has been done

* Against will
* Against reason
* Against character

#### Third Reason

Mr Darcy has caused the separation between Jane and Bingley
> Had not my own feelings decided against you — had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?

Darcy reaction is unexpected, since she thinks he would be remorseful, but he isn’t.

#### Fourth Reason

Mr Wickham is a negative character. Before Mr Wickham father died, Darcy promised that he would help his son to start a career, and so he did. He get him a sum of money, but Wickham squandered this money on whores, drinking and gambling; then he became an army officer.
After he had squandered all his money he came back to Darcy to ask him more money, which he refuses. So Wickham eloped with Georgiana, Darcy’s sister who was then 13. Darcy had to go and get his sister back.
When Wickham meets Elizabeth tell her that Mr Darcy has appropriated his own money, and so Elizabeth believes in him.

In the end, Elizabeth believes that Darcy has deprived Wickham of his right inheritance.
> “And of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth with energy. “You have reduced him to his present state of poverty — comparative poverty. You have withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for him. You have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule.”

#### Fifth reason

When Elizabeth and Darcy first met, she overhears Darcy saying to Bingley that the only girl at the ball who could attract his attention is Jane, and that Elizabeth is tolerable. She is not beautiful enough to **tempt** him

Their first meeting so has been negative.

---

Mr Darcy at her negation became pale, and he feels very bad: he is **surprised**, **angry** and **upset**.

But Mr Darcy is strong, and doesn’t accept all his accusation. He accuses her to be pride. He is dignified.
> these offences might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.

Her reaction is even stronger: she says terrible phrases
> You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it.

Darcy feels **astonished**, **incredule** and **mortification**.
At the end he goes away.

After that he leaves, she cries for hours, because she realizes that she had refused the man she loved.

### The End

After a while she receive a letter from Mr Darcy, where he admits separating Jane and Bingley because he though that Jane was not in love with Mr Bingley. At the same time he reveals the truth about Wickham and his misbehavior.

Elizabeth starts reconsidering her attitude towards Wickham, Darcy and herself. The truth bursts out on her suddenly, and the change is permanent: she doesn’t have doubt about Darcy anymore.
When she experiences this **epiphany** many themes are concerned

1. **Pride**
2. **Vanity**
3. **Prejudice**
4. **Love**
5. **Reason**

Elizabeth balances good and bad qualities and she comes out changed after this long self reflection. She becomes aware that her good qualities became distorted and useless when they are influenced by vanity, mistrust and prejudice.
Now Elizabeth is humiliated, because she understands that she has made a mistake, but she is undergoing a process of self realization which makes her suffer, but which will make her a better person.

In the end the two characters will came together

# The Victorian Age
==p. 405 - IV==

> It was the best of time, it was the worst of times. It was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity. It was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair
>
>— Charles Dickens, The Tale of Two Cities

It was an age of contradiction and opposites: age of progress, but also of problems in justice.

The Victorian Age usually is meant from 1837 - 1901, during the reign of Queen Victoria. Actually the Victorian Age started in 1832, with the _Great Reform Bill_, a law, which is usually taken as the watershed between the romantic age and the victorian age.
This Reform Bill shifted political power from the hands of the landowners to the hands of manufacturer. It implied cultural changes as well.

## Social area
The new ruling classes were as ruthless as those that had governed Britain during the first phase of industrial revolution, but they began to be gradually aware of the inhuman levels of exploitation of the workers: they were more careful on the workers:
* at a political level this awareness gave rise to a serious of reforms that in the end improved the conditions of life and work of the proletarians, avoiding at the same time that social revolution that, according to Marx’s analysis, should have taken place in Britain first;
* among the common affluent people this awareness took the form of humanitarianism, philanthropy and sentimentalism;
* the Victorian novelist, mostly belonging to the middle classes, shared the same values and models of life of their reading public, and approached with this attitude to the main problems of their times; they felt a sense of guilt, and they find a solution in philanthropy, and they acted according to philanthropy granted from a position of social and economic privilege; at the same time they thought that their only responsibility was to expose their problems
* there were some _good points_:
  1. more general **prosperity** that was spreading in Britain;
  2. medical, mechanical and scientific **progress**;
  3. improvement of **literacy**
  4. the reform of a **middle class parliament**, conceded to the working classes, created a widespread belief that social peace was possible and that progress was limitless
  * these good points account for the optimism which characterized the whole period, and for the self-confidence and self-complacency of the middle classes which were alse able to impose their values on the working class; the most important value was _respectability_
* the _negative points_ are:
  1. **poverty**
  2. **prostitution**
  3. **exploitation of labour**
  4. **cruelty to children**
  * these evils were removed from the conscience of people by being concealed under the veil of hypocrisy;
  * it was a characteristic tendency of the victorian society to deceive itself in relation to its responsibilities and faults; some political writers exposed this attitude, attacking the fundamental insensitivity of their times

---

The Victorian Age was a very complex age, marked by religious, social and political unrest and confusion.

The country underwent a gradual but continuous process of democratisation, and greater freedom was given to catholics

The class that benefited most from the changes of the time was the middle class, which was made up of manufactures, merchants and bankers.
This class increased in power, and took the control of the Government. This class was also favoured by progress in industrial and technological field.

This situation led to widespread optimism, due to colonial expansion, scientific and technical results, and improvement in transports.
Middle class people believe that _happines_ could be reached **through technical progress**.

The Victorians were proud of their **welfare**, of their good manners, of their middle class values, and tended to ignore the social problems that still afflicted most of the population.
The working class lived in misery and distress. The new hurbans conditions, and the growth of slums have created a lot of health problems.
Whole families were often crowded in a single room, where lack of hygiene, occasionally led to cholera.

The government create the **work houses**, in order to solve these problems.
They were institutions built by government and run by parishes, where families who couldn’t support themselves were confined. Here sexes were segregated and people were barely fed. People were always hungry and dirty and miserable.

The reason why the work houses were built was the poverty, whether it was the result of bad behaviour or bad luck, was virtually regarded as a crime, and it was penalised as such. This was the mentality for which workhouses were created.
Also debtors were held in work houses, or at least in jail.

Also education had his problems, because teachers were often incompetent, but they controlled the students through corporal punishment.

This particular situation which saw prosperity and progress on the one hand, and poverty, ugliness and injustice on the other, which opposed conformism to corruption, moralism and philanthropy to money and capitalistic greediness, and which separated private life from public behaviour, was called **Victorian Compromise**.

The situation nevertheless aroused the concern of many and many reformers and theorists, who, for social or humanitarian reasons, tried to improve living conditions of the poor, at all levels, including hospitals, schools and prisons.
It is thanks to their care and actions that parliament passed so many acts regulating work, sanitation, the condition of children, the exploitation of teenagers.

### Evangelicalism
A religious movement that acted in this period was **Evangelicalism**; it was inspired by the teachings of John Wesley, the founder of **Methodism**.
The evangelicals were deeply concerned with _human problems_ and _social reforms_. They contributed to the _abolition of slavery_ and the _First Reform Bill_.
They had a puritanical view of life, so they advocate
* the abolition of certain public entertainments,
* a strict observance of Sunday
* very strict code of behavior.

### Bentham’s Utilitarianism
==p. 12 - V==

According to Utilitarianism, an action is morally right if it has consequences that lead to happiness, and wrong if it brings about the reverse. Therefore all institutions should be tested in the light of reason and common sense to determine whether they are useful, measuring the extent to which they provide for the material happiness of the greatest number of people.
Utilitarianism suited the interests of the middle class and contributed to the Victorian conviction that any problem could be overcome through reason.

### Fabian Society
It was in this particular atmosphere that the **Fabian Society** was founded in 1884, by Sidney and Beatrice Webbs. It was inspired by Marxist doctrines, and it consists in **socialists** who advocated gradual reforms instead of drastic revolutionary measures.
Its name derived from _Quintus Fabius Maximus_, which was a general called “the delayer”, because in his campagne against Annibale avoided direct engagement.

### Respectability
Manners underwent a deep change in this period; under the influence of Queen Victoria herself the age became excessively **puritan**; sex became a taboo subject, and all the words with sexual connotation were replaced by synonyms.

The key word in this period was ==**respectability**==

#### Victorian Family
The conventional morality of the time found its best expression within the family, where the father was the _authority_ and the mother was to be _submissive_ and _fruitful_. In fact Victorian Families were usually very large, also because Queen Victoria herself had 9 children.

Middle class women were expected to be _frail_, _innocent_ and _pure_. They were confined within the family. They were devoted to _respectable jobs_ like teaching.

But restrictions involved men too; they were forbidden to gamble, swear and drink hard.

Clothes were very formal because appearance was very important.

#### The Victorian House
Victorian people were busy with making money and social climbing, so they had little time for art, and this indifference led to bad taste in buildings and furnishings.
These needed to be a status symbols, and so houses became pretentious, but _not beautiful_.  The interiors were overcrowded with _ornaments_, _decorations_ and _furniture_.

## Challenges from the scientific field
==p. 13 - V==

In his work _On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection_ Charle Darwin presented his theory of evolution and natural selection. He later developed it in his work _The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex_.
According to Darwin’s theory:
* all living creatures in existence have developed their forms through a slow process of change and adaptation in a struggle for survival;
* favorable physical conditions determine the survival of a species, unfavorable ones its extinction ;
* man evolved, like any other animal, from a less highly organized form, namely a monkey.

On the one hand, Darwin’s theory discarded the version of creation given by the Bible; on the other hand, it seemed to show that the universe was not static but perpetually developing, that the strongest survived and the weakest deserved to be defeated.

### The Oxford Movement
==p. 13 - V==

British Catholics replied to the challenges of science by returning to the ancient doctrines and rituals. The religious revival found its expression in the movement headed by the English cardinal John Henry Newman, which went under the name of “Oxford Movement” because it began at Oxford University.

## Queen Victoria
She belongs to the Hanoverians (George I, George II, William IV). She was the niece of William IV, and she took the throne when she was only **18 yo**, and she would reign for 64 years and she would became a symbol of the entire age.

## Reforms

When Victoria got to the throne she found a Country in difficult conditions, because there was discontent among the working classes, due to a period of _economical crisis_.
### Chartist Movement
A direct consequence of this economical crisis was the birth of the **Chartist Movement**: their name went from their proposal of a charter of reforms, made up of 6 points:
1. _universal suffrage_
2. _annual parliament_
3. _payment for parliament member_; so far the member of parliament were not paid, so only rich people could afford to stay there
4. the _right for a man without proprieties to be elected_
5. _secret ballot_
6. _equal electoral districts_; until that moment the electoral districts were of the same area and dimensions, without taking care of the density of population; in this way it was very easy for affluent people to control districts with a small number of people (called _rotten boroughs_)

This petition was not accepted in parliament, and so Chartist disappeared from policy in 1848, since they were considered politically immature, and their projects were doomed to failure, but with the passing of time all their reforms had been actuated, but for the _annual parliament_.

### Parties and politics

In 1825 the ==**Trade Unions**== [sindacati] were legalized, and they became stronger and stronger. In 1868 there was the first Trade Union Congress, and a status was given to the movement.

The long reign of queen Victoria saw a succession of great Prime Ministers, some belonging to the Tories (now conservatives), and some belonging to the Wigs (now liberals; in the modern parliament is the Labour to oppose to Conservative, born in 1906).
The two parties, that were ==**Tories and Wigs**==, had different opinions, but they agreed for a second and a third _Reform Bill_.
* The **Second Reform Bill** was passed in 1867, and it extended the right of vote to Town Labourers, while peasants and miners couldn’t vote.
* Only with the **Third Reform Bill**, in 1884, that the latter were given a right to vote. In this way the number of electors doubled, since suffrage had been extended to all male workers

It only refers, obviously, to men. _Women couldn’t vote_

Many representatives of the working class may now be elected, entering the _house of commons_.

In 1897 the **independent Labour party** was formed (born as a movement), and finally the working class may compete widely for politically power. They were transformed into a real party in 1900, and had a great political success in 1906.

### Economical reforms

An other social question was the ==price of **corn**==; it was kept artificially high by the government, through protective tariffs there were called the _Corn laws_, which restricted the importation of foreign corn.
An association was formed against the Corn laws, and it obtained the repeal [cancellazione] of these laws in 1846, with the support of a conservative Prime Minister, Peel.
The repeal caused much discontent in the _Conservative Party_, since it wanted to protect the interests of the _landed gentry_, by which it was largely supported.

The upper class and the industrial class both believed in a policy of ==**Free Trade**==, that is an uncontrolled flow of commercial transactions with foreign nations. It was a free exchange of good, without protective tariffs, and it brought great wealth to England.

### Other reforms

The Victorian Age was marked by a great number of social achievements and reforms;
* **The Factory Act**, which regulated and improved the conditions of workers in factory
* **Ten Hours’ Act**, which limited the working hours to ten a day, for both men and women.
* **The Mines Act**, which prohibited the working of women and children in mines
* **The Public Health Act**, which improved health condition
* **The Education Act**, which reorganized elementary education
* **Adoption of the English week**, by which Saturday Afternoon was devoted to pleasure and entertainment


## Foreign Policy

### Ireland
The population of Ireland consisted mainly of Catholics, and they were very poor and they became even poorer by recurrent famines; with only potato crops to feed on.
In the 1840’s there was a potato famine, and so potato crops failed several times; this caused mass starvation and emigration.
In order to stop a mass emigration and starvation, Charles Parnell, which was an irish leader, demanded Home Rule (an independent constitution), but these reforms were rejected twice by the conservatives, and Ireland obtained Home Rule only after WWI.

### British Colonial Empire
The Victorian Age was above all the period in which the great British Colonial Empire took its final form.

There was an enlargement of the indian territories, as a consequence of the indian mutiny [ammutinamento indiano] in 1857, and after this mutiny England acquired the control of India. In 1876, Queen Victoria became Empress of India, that was India, Bangladesh and Pakistan.

The English Empire had enormous proportions, involving Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, Ceylon, Singapore, Hong Kong, Gibraltar, Malta and Cyprus.

This period is characterized by two wars:
* from 1899 to 1902 England was at war against two south-african areas, called Orange and Transvaal; these two areas were interesting because there were diamonds and gold; these two regions were ruled by dutch colonists, called Boers; it gave England the supremacy over the two dutch reasons
* **The Crimean War**: it was the only international’s war during Victoria’s Reign; it was originated by a dispute between Turkey and Russia, over the boundaries of the Turkish empire.; England and France, declared war on Russia, together with Turkey, because they were afraid of the growing power of Russia in the balkans; the war broke out in 1854 and 1857; Russia was defeated, but the conflict exposed the disorganization of the English Army particularly in the field of sanitation; public opinion was horrified at the news to the terrible conditions in which sick and wounded soldiers were kept; a young lady of noble origins, **Florence Nightingale** went to Crimea organized hospitals, obtained nurses medicines and bandages from England, laid the foundations of Medical Services for soldiers; she inspired the creation of the Women’s Corps in the international _Red Cross_.

## Victorian Poetry
==p. 22 - V==

During Victoria’s Reign poetry became more concerned with social reality.
This led on the one hand to the creation of majestic poetry linked to the myth and the belief of the greatness of England; on the other hand to the creation of poetry more inclined towards anti-myth and disbelief which had to solve the ethical problems raised by science and progress

Now the poet was seen as a “prophet” and a “philosopher”. People expected that he could reconcile faith and progress, as well as sprinkle a little romance over the unromantic materialism of modern life.

The major poets of the age were **Alfred Tennyson** and **Robert Browning**.

Victorian Poetry started as a revival of Romanticism but soon mirrored the sense of uneasiness that characterized the Victorian Age.
The most important poets were **Alfred Tennyson** and **Robert Browning** and they felt a moral responsibility through their poems towards their public.

## The later years of Queen Victoria

#### The Liberal and Conservative Parties {ignore=true}

When Prince Albert tragically died from typhoid in 1861, Queen Victoria withdrew from society and spent the next ten years in mourning. She still remained an important figure even though the political panorama was changing with the regrouping of the parties. The Liberal Party, as it was called from the 1860s, included the former Whigs, some Radicals and a large minority of businessmen; the party was led by William Gladstone (1809 98). The Conservative Party, which had evolved from the Tories in the 1830s, reaffirmed its position under the leadership of Benjamin Disraeli (1804-81).

#### Benjamin Disraeli {ignore=true}

Disraeli briefly became Prime

Minister in 1868 and regained the office after the elections in 1874. In his second term, his government passed an Artisans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act (1875), which allowed local public authorities to clear the slums and provided housing for the poor; a Public Health Act (1875), which provided sanitation as well as running water; and a Factory Act (1878), which limited the working hours per week. Disraeli's foreign policy was dominated by the Eastern Question, that is, the decay of the Ottoman Empire and the attempt by other European countries, such as Russia, to gain power there. In 1875 Disraeli encouraged the purchase of more shares in the Suez Canal Company to protect Britain's route to the East.

#### William Gladstone {ignore=true}

Gladstone was Prime Minister four times, starting in 1868. At that time, reforming legislation focused on education. Elementary schools had long been organised by the Church; the 1870 Education Act started a national system by introducing 'board schools, mainly in the poorer areas of the towns. By 1880 elementary education had become compulsory. Other reforms included the legalisation of trade unions in 1871, with the Trade Union Act, and the introduction of the secret ballot at elections in 1872, with the Ballot Act.
Gladstone was re-elected three times (1880, 1886, 1892). The Third Reform Act of 1884 extended voting to all male householders, including miners, mill-workers and farm labourers. This extension of the franchise gave public opinion an important role as a political force.
The Irish Parliamentary Party, sitting as a group in Westminster and led by Charles Stewart Parnell (1846-91), demanded self-government for Ireland - the so-called 'Home Rule. Gladstone believed that Home Rule was the way to bring peace to Ireland and tried to get Parliament to pass a bill three times; but an Irish government was granted only after World War I.

#### The Anglo-Boer Wars {ignore=true}

The struggle with France at the beginning of the 19th century had led to Britain's global hegemony - with its naval power and its enormous financial and economic strength, Britain seemed invulnerable. However, since Waterloo, its foreign policy had been defensive. Many areas of the world were characterised by political and cultural fragmentation and it was there that Britain began to gain control without major political intervention. This was the situation in South America, in Asia and most of all in Africa, where Britain competed with the other European countries to divide up the continent. In South Africa, by the 1870s, the British controlled two colonies, Cape Colony and Natal, while the Dutch settlers, the Boers, had the two republics of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. When Britain took over Transvaal in 1877, the Boers rebelled and war broke out. The Boer Wars (1880-1902) ended in 1902 with a British victory.

#### Empress of India {ignore=true}

In 1877 Queen Victoria was given a new title, Empress of India. In the last decades of the 19th century, the British Empire occupied an area of 4 million square miles and more than 400 million people were ruled over by the British. The Empire, however, was becoming more difficult to control. There was a growing sense of the white man's burden, a difficult combination of the duty to spread Christian civilisation, encouraging toleration and open communication and at the same time promoting commercial interests. It was a strongly felt obligation to provide leadership where States were failing or non existent, especially in Africa and India. India was economically important as a market for British goods and strategically necessary to British control of Asia from the Persian Gulf to Shanghai. By 1850 the East India Company directly ruled most of northern, central and south-eastern India. In the late Victorian period the new imperial government became more ambitious and through free market economics it destroyed traditional farming and caused the deindustrialisation of India. At one time the main manufacturer of cotton cloth for the world, India, now became the largest importer of England's cotton.

#### The end of an era {ignore=true}

The Victorian Age came to an end with the death of Queen Victoria in 1901. For almost a century she had embodied decorum, stability and continuity. Her Golden and Diamond Jubilees for 50 and 60 years on the throne had been celebrated with huge public parades, and for her funeral London streets were packed with mourners. She was buried beside her beloved husband in the Frogmore mausoleum at Windsor Castle.

## The late Victorians

#### Victorian urban society and women {ignore=true}

In the later years of Victoria's reign, Britain was primarily an urban society. Victorian cities had gas lighting, rubbish collection and there were many public buildings, such as town halls, railway stations, libraries and museums, music halls, boarding schools and hospitals, police stations and prisons. This was a period of a retail consumer boom - with many new shops, public houses and theatres. Even now some Victorian institutions can still be seen in British cities.

Middle-class women became increasingly involved in public life as leaders in campaigns against prostitution, as teachers and as volunteer charitable workers. Further education opportunities for women became available with the opening of women's colleges in the 1870s. However, a strong taboo remained regarding family issues such as control over property, conditions of divorce and rights over children as well as questions of sex and childbirth. The 1882 Married Women's Property Act gave married women the right to own and manage their own property independently of their husbands for the first time.

#### Social Darwinism {ignore=true}

Darwin's theory of evolution became the foundation for various ethical and social systems, such as Social Darwinism, which developed in the 1870s. The philosopher Herbert Spencer (1820-1903) applied Darwin's theory of natural selection to human society: he argued that races, nations and social classes, like biological species, were subject to the principle of the survival of the fittest and that the poor and oppressed did not deserve compassion.

Eugenics was a similar interpretation created by Darwin's cousin, Sir Francis Galton (1822 1911), and attracting many intellectuals. They exhorted the middle classes, regarded as nature's fittest, to reproduce more, especially educated women who seemed to neglect their racial duty to breed.

#### Late Victorian thinkers {ignore=true}

In the second half of the 19th century, Britain reached the peak of its power abroad; however. some ideological conflicts were beginning to undermine the self-confident attitude that had characterised the first part of Victoria's reign. Changes regarded several fields, especially scientific achievements, industrialisation. sexuality and religion, and a growing pessimism began to affect intellectuals and artists, who expressed in different ways their sense of doubt about the stability of Victorian society. Among the thinkers of the late Victorian period, a significant role was played by those who protested against the harm caused by industrialism in man's life and in the environment. Karl Marx (1818-83) based the theories he expressed in his treatise in three volumes Das Kapital (1867, 1885, 1894) upon research done in England, the most advanced European industrial nation of the time, His works influenced some English writers like the art critic John Ruskin (1819-1900)and the artist William Morris (1834-96). They were looking for a different form of progress, a blend of utopianism and nostalgia in which the future in many ways resembled the past. While studying at Oxford in the 1850s, William Morris drew inspiration from Ruskin's works on Gothic architecture and his criticism of the inhumanity of industrialisation, and from Thomas Malory's medieval romance Le Morte d'Arthur. Together with the Pre Raphaelite painters, he started a battle against the age he was living in. He set up a firm to produce craft-made furniture, wallpaper and other decorative objects as a reaction to utilitarian mass-produced goods. In 1883 he became a militant in the Social Democratic Federation.

#### The spread of socialists ideas {ignore=true}

The 1880s saw the rise of an organised political left after the foundation of the Fabian Society in 1884. It was a middle-class socialist group whose members aimed at transforming Britain into a socialist State not through revolution, as Marx advised, but by systematic, progressive reforms. Its early members included Sidney and Beatrice Webb and George Bernard Shaw. The Independent Labour Party was set up in 1893; it was a non-Marxist socialist party which attracted both male and female intellectuals. Various socialist groups were joined by young skilled workers and intellectuals who read John Ruskin's criticism of the greed, competition and ugliness of industrial society.

#### Patriotism {ignore=true}

In the late 19th century, expressions of civic pride and national fervour were frequent among the British. Patriotism was deeply influenced by ideas of racial superiority.
Towards the end of Victoria's reign the British considered themselves the leaders of European civilisation. There was a belief that the 'races' of the world were divided by fundamental physical and intellectual differences, that some were destined to be led by others. It was thus an obligation imposed by God on the British to spread their superior way of life, their institutions, law and political system on native peoples throughout the world. This attitude came to be known as Jingoism. Colonial power and economic progress made for the optimistic outlook of many Victorians.

## The Victorian Novel

#### Readers and writers {ignore=true}

During the Victorian Age, for the first time, there was a communion of interests and opinions between writers and their readers. One reason for this close relationship was the enormous growth of the middle classes. Although its members belonged to many different levels where literacy had penetrated in a heterogeneous way, they were avid consumers of literature. They borrowed books from circulating libraries and read the abundant variety of periodicals. Moreover, Victorian writers themselves often belonged to the middle class.

#### The publishing word {ignore=true}

A great deal of Victorian literature was first published in a serial form. Essays, verse and even novels made their first appearance in instalments in the pages of periodicals. This allowed the writer to feel he was in constant contact with his public. He was obliged to maintain the interest of his story gripping because one boring instalment would cause the public not to buy that periodical any longer. There was a further advantage because an author could always alter the story, according to its success or failure. Reviewers also had a strong influence on the reception of literary works and on the shaping of public opinion.

#### The Victorians' interest in prose {ignore=true}

The Victorians showed a marked interest in prose, and the greatest literary achievement of the age is to be found in the novel, which soon became the most popular form of literature and the main source of entertainment. The spread of scientific knowledge made the novel realistic and analytical, the spread of democracy made it social and humanitarian, while the spirit of moral unrest made it inquisitive and critical.

#### The novelist's aim {ignore=true}

During the 18th century, novels generally dealt with the adventures either of a social outcast or a more virtuous hero, but their episodic structure remained the same. The idea of a thematic unity was brought in by Jane Austen, with the theme of a girl's choice of a husband, and by the Gothic writers who set their novels in a remote, at times strange and exotic, past. In the 1840s novelists felt they had a moral and social responsibility to fulfill. They wanted to reflect the social changes that had been in progress for a long time, such as the Industrial Revolution, the struggle for democracy and the growth of towns and cities. The novelists of the first part of the Victorian period described society as they saw it, and, with the exception of those sentiments which offended current morals, particularly regarding sex, nothing escaped their scrutiny. They were aware of the evils of their society, such as the terrible conditions of manual workers and the exploitation of children. However, their criticism was much less radical than that of contemporary European writers, like Balzac, Flaubert, Turgenev and Dostoyevsky, because the historical conditions of Britain were quite different from those of France or Russia.
Didacticism was one of the main features of Victorian novels, because novelists also conceived literature as a vehicle to correct the vices and weaknesses of the age.

#### The narrative technique {ignore=true}

The voice of the omniscient narrator provided a comment on the plot and erected a rigid barrier between 'right' and 'wrong' behaviours, light and darkness. Retribution and punishment were to be found in the final chapter of the novel, where the whole texture of events, adventures and incidents had to be explained and justified

#### Setting and characters {ignore=true}

The setting chosen by most Victorian novelists was the city, which was the main symbol of the industrial civilisation as well as the expression of anonymous lives and lost identities.
In their effort to portray the individual motives for human action and all that binds men and women to the community, Victorian writers concentrated on the creation of realistic characters the public could easily identify with, in terms of comedy - especially Dickens's characters - or dramatic passion the Brontë sisters' heroines.

#### Types of novels {ignore=true}

* **The novel of manners**. It kept close to the original 19th-century models. It dealt with economic and social problems and described a particular class or situation. A master of this genre was William M. Thackeray.
* **The humanitarian novel**. Charles Dickens's novels are mostly admired for their tone, combining humour with a sentimental request for reform for the less fortunate. They constitute the bulk of what is generally called the 'humanitarian noveľ or the 'novel of purpose, which could be divided into novels of a realistic, fantastic' or 'moral nature according to their predominant tone or issue dealt with.
* **The novel of formation**. The _Bildungsroman_ (novel of formation or education) became very popular after the publication of Charlotte Brontë's _Jane Eyre_ and Dickens's _David Copperfield_. These novels dealt with one character's development from early youth to some sort of maturity. The works by the Brontë sisters can be linked to the persistence of the Romantic and Gothic traditions; they focus on intense subjective experiences rather than on a world of social interaction.
* **Literary nonsense**. A particular aspect of Victorian literature is what is called 'nonsense, created by Edward Lear (1812-88) and Lewis Carroll. In his famous novel _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_ (1865), Carroll created a nonsensical universe where the social rules and conventions are disintegrated, the cause-effect relationship does not exist, and time and space have lost their function of giving an order to human experience.

#### Women writers {ignore=true}

It is important to underline that a great number of novels published during the mid-Victorian period, up to 1870-80, were written by women such as Charlotte and Emily Brontë and George Eliot (the pen name of Mary Ann Evans). This output is surprising considering the state of subjection of Victorian women. It is less surprising if one remembers that the majority of novel-buyers and readers were women. Middle-class women had more time to spend at home than men and could devote part of the day to reading. However, it was not easy to get published, and some women used a male pseudonym in order to see their work in print. Creative writing, like art and other public activities, was considered 'masculine'. From Jane Austen to George Eliot, the woman's novel had moved in the direction of a realistic exploration of the daily lives and values of women within the family and the community

## Aestheticism and Decadence

#### The birth of the Aesthetic Movement {ignore=true}

The Aesthetic Movement developed in the universities and intellectual circles in the last decades of the 19th century. It began in France with Théophile Gautier (1811-72) and reflected the sense of frustration and uncertainty of the artist, his reaction against the materialism and the restrictive moral code of the bourgeoisie, and his need to redefine the role of art. As a result, French artists withdrew from the political and social scene and escaped into aesthetic isolation, into what Gautier defined 'Art for art's sake'. The bohémien embodies his protest against the monotony and vulgarity of bourgeois life, leading an unconventional existence, pursuing sensation and excess, and cultivating art and beauty.

#### The English Aesthetic Movement {ignore=true}

This doctrine was imported into England by James McNeill Whistler (1834-1903), an American painter who worked in England.
However, the roots of the English Aesthetic Movement can be traced back to the Romantic poet John Keats, as well as to Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Rossetti was a remarkable example of an artist dedicated wholly to his art. John Ruskin too, in his search for beauty in life and art, even while insisting upon moral values, paved the way for the works of Walter Pater (1839-94), who is regarded as the main theorist of the Aesthetic Movement in England.

#### The theorist of English Aestheticism {ignore=true}

Walter Pater's _Studies in the History of the Renaissance_ (1873) and his masterpiece _Marius the Epicurean_ (1885) were immediately successful, especially with the young, because of their subversive and potentially demoralising message. He rejected religious faith and said that art was the only means to halt the passage of time, the only certainty. He thought life should be lived in the spirit of art, namely as a work of art, filling each passing moment with intense experience, feeling all kinds of sensations. The task of the artist was to feel sensations, to be attentive to the attractive, the courteous and the cheerful. So the artist was seen as the transcriber 'not of the world, not of mere fact, but of his sense of it! The main implication of this new aesthetic position was that art had no reference to life, and therefore it had nothing to do with morality and did not need to be didactic.

#### Walter Pater's influence {ignore=true}

Pater's works had a deep influence on the poets and writers of the 1890s, especially Oscar Wilde, as well as the group of artists that met in the Rhymers' Club and contributed to _The Yellow Book_. This periodical, published from 1894 to 1897, reflected decadent' taste in its sensational subjects. The term decadent' generally implied a process of decline of recognised values. By the end of the century it was used as an aesthetic term across Europe.

#### The features of Aesthetic works {ignore=true}

A number of features can be distinguished in the works of Aesthetic artists:
* excessive attention to the self;
* hedonistic and sensuous attitude;
* perversity in subject matter;
* disenchantment with contemporary society;
* evocative use of language.

#### The European Decadent Movement {ignore=true}

Decadence must be seen as a European movement. In the late 1880s a group of French writers contributed to the journal _Le Décadent_; they were the Symbolists Rimbaud, Verlaine,Mallarmé, Laforgue, who were much influenced by Charles Baudelaire's _Les Fleurs du mal_ (1857). Joris-Karl Huysmans (1848-1907) wrote _A rebours_ (1884), a novel whose hero, Des Esseintes, tries to create an entirely artificial life in his search for unusual sensations. This character became the model for Wilde's dandy. The main representatives of Decadence in Italy were Gabriele D'Annunzio (1863-1938), with his novel _Il piacere_ (1889), and the poets Giovanni Pascoli (1855-1912) and Guido Gozzano (1883-1916). The poetry of Rainer Maria Rilke (1875-1926) was one of the most remarkable expressions of the Decadent sensibility in the German language.

## Victorian Drama
* ==p. 31==

Very little drama or not was produced in the Victorian period: the decline in the production of dramatic words is caused by:
1. predominance of the novel
2. the power acquired by the theatrical managers, who preferred to stage well known traditional plays, rather than try out new ones; many companies mainly performed Shakespeare, although with many of the text cut or even changed, in order to better suit the victorian tastes
3. many victorians did not appreciate drama as a form of art, since they still consider actor and actresses as people of little respectability and doubtful morality

There is one great innovation, related to the Victorian playhouse: the new theaters became smaller but more pretentious; they could be afforded only by the well off.

The typical features of the Victorian playhouse:
* semicircular
* lighted by gas light and later on by electricity, while the audience was left in darkness
* the stage was separated from the audience by a curtain, and this allowed the scenery to be changed

The new playhouses tended towards a more realistic staging, which made more use of actions and movement, and of setting. The keyword was to **reach the illusion of reality**.
The stage directions became longer and much more detailed.

On the one hand, through the use of this theatrical machinery, the staging was more spectacular but on the other hand there were also some negative consequences:
* this type of staging was more expensive: for the theatrical manager it became unprofitable to stage different plays during the same theatrical season
* the victorian age was a period of great performers, so actors and actresses demanded a higher salary for their job.

This finally leads to a lost of flexibility, who brought managers to stage traditions well know tragedies instead of new ones.

The **audience** at the time went to the theatre just to be amused, and not to meditate on problems.The type of theatre that the victorians demanded was farce spectacol and above all Melodrama.

This latter kind of theatre, **melodrama** was probably the most appreciated: they are highly schematic plays with stereotypical characters, absurd plots. The common features of all melodrama, is that good must triumph over evil. The victorian appreciated the morality on which melodrama was based, because the spectator could easily identify themself with the hero.
For certain aspects we can say that melodrama returned to the morality plays of the Middle Ages.

There is a more innovating and subversive type of theatre that was emerging at the time, of the form of **music hall**. They are a type of theatrical entertainment, characterized by a mixture of comedy and popular song. Music hall was considered a low form of theatre, also because it dealt with taboo subjects, such as sex. It dealt with these taboo subjects using the tecnique of the _double meaning_.
It was mainly appreciated by the working classes, and even though it was considered a low form of theatre, it was to be of great influence in the 20th century, both on early cinema, especially in the films of _Charlie Chaplin_, and on the work of Samuel Beckett.

After this period of stagnation, in which we have almost a gap in the production of new plays worth of note, with the last quarter of the 19th century, British Drama begins to show the first signs of revival. In fact the 1890s marked a reinessance in English dramatic art.

This period of renaissance in theatre wasn't limited to the British context. Drama was changing and improving all of the Europe, and we can now outline the influences coming from abroad, which had an impact on British drama.

### Chekhov

He was Russian. He replaced the lack of action with a constant inquiring into the psychology of his characters

### Strindberg
He is a Swedish playwright who mixed naturalism with psychology, providing a deeper insight into life, together with penetrating studies of women.

### Ibsen

He is from Norway. He modified the structure of the play by the _retrospective method_: disregarding the traditional method of construction based on 3 phases (_antecedent_, _climax_, _conclusion_), he skipped the antecedent and started just before the climax.
He used the stage as an instrument for social criticism and for attacks on bourgeois hypocrisy.
He confronted his audience with real life problems, without indulging in humour or any other form of relief
Features of Ibsen’s plays:
- introduction of problem drama
- realism in characters and language
- psychological exploration
- rejection of sentimentalism
- rejection of conventional moral ending
- defence of women’s independence
- focus on middle class people
- social commitment

His influence was particularly evidente on the works of **George Bernard Shaw**, who was one of the main British playwright of the period. It is almost ironical to note that Wilde and Shaw had two opposite careers:
- during his life time Oscar Wilde's commedies were highly appreciated; he satires the values of the Victorian upper classes, but he did so in a very subtle way, which did not offend the people he was satirising; it was more Wilde's life and his homosexuality that made people turn the vindictively against him
- Shaw was an highly respected people, he was the model of decency, but his plays were not appreciated at the time, because they criticize to harshly the society of the time. He saw the theatre as an instrument for social and political change.
On the contrary Wilde denied the moral significant of art.

# Robert Browning
## Life
He was born in 1820, and he died in 1889, in London.
He had a happy childhood, and his mother was very religious and a good musician.

It was his father who really educated him. He had little formal education, since he never attended school, and he only attended London University for short time.
He started writing poems when he was very young, still a boy, and he loved Italy, and he would spend all his youth and middle years in Italy.

The only memorable event of his life was his marriage with **Elizabeth Barrett**; she was 6 years older than him; they had to marry secretly because her father didn’t want her to marry him.
She died in 1861, and after he died he went back to England from Italy.

At the end of his life, he settled in Venice, and he died there.

After his death his corpse was claimed by England, and he was buried in **Poet’s corner** in _Westminster Abbey_.

## Dramatic monologue
He is outstanding because he created a new kind of poem, called **Dramatic Monologue**.

The Dramatic Monologue was not invented by Browning, but he actually inherited it from past writers, especially from _Shakespeare_; he wrote, especially in _Hamlet_ and _Macbeth_ long soliloquies, that are extended passages recited by one person; they are addressed to no-one in particular, but to the audience at large.
Through the soliloquy the character reveals his faults, his thoughts to the audience, while giving the impression that he is speaking to himself.

Browning chooses this poetic form because it gives him the possibility of **psychological exploration**; but he transformed the soliloquy into a **monologue** by means of the following devices:
1. he turned the soliloquy into a complete lyrical poem with a precise metrical structure;
2. he avoided any autobiographical reference, by introducing a third person, a speaker, who speaks about himself or about someone else;
3. he replaced the audience with one or more silent listeners, to whom the speaker addresses;
4. he called his monologues **dramatic**, in the sense of _theatrical_ (in fact they are dramas with characters) and _crucial_ (because the speaker is caught in a moment of crisis);
5. Browning preserves the **dramatic irony**, present in Elizabethan Soliloquies, since the speaker does not realize that what he is revealing to the listeners is excessive and dangerous;
6. he made his characters not only individuals not only individuals but stereotypes (symbols of a category or of an age);
7. he decided to use blank verse, which is _unrhymed iambic pentameter_, but the punctuation respected the line of thought, and this gave the impression of spoken language;
8. he set his monologues in a distant historical period, because he didn’t want to be involved.

## Poetry
He appreciated the arts and intelligent tourism, and he believed in progress: he was absolutely Victorian (optimistic).
He believed that everything offered to our experience, be it good or evil, is useful: evil is the necessary challenge for man to achieve good; in that way life becomes a battlefield, on which human beings must use all their energy, will and activity.

Browning started writing under Shelly’s influence, and he found his own style in the dramatic monologue, because he wanted to be objective and dramatic.

He wrote 3 types of dramatic monologues:
1. **Ironic self portraits** which continued the tradition of Chaucer’s _Canterbury Tales_; the irony which is used in these monologues is involuntary, because the protagonist doesn’t seem to realize that what he is saying will be imputed to him as guilt. _My Last Duchess_ belongs to this group.
2. In the second group Browning sets out to explore a **human problem**, and the monologue is usually a speech of defense made by the protagonist himself. _Frà Lippo Lippi_ and _Andrea del Sarto_ belongs to this group.
3. The last group are **love lyrics**; here the poet offers his tender invitations and his reflections to a woman; the themes are _love_, _music_, _religion_, _painting_.

Browning was a very prolific author; he wrote a lot of poems, plays and books, but most of his works are **obscure**,  and the most remarkable are his collection of poems, such as _Dramatic Lyrics_, and _Men and Women_.
In these _Dramatic Lyrics_ there is a subgroup titled _Madhouse Cells_, where he analyses the personality of mad people, the psychology of crazy people.
The two most famous poems are _My Last Duchess_ and _Porphyria’s Lover_.

## T: Porphyria’s Lovers
==p. 23 - V==

He talks about a murder: a man kills his lover because she is not ready to leave her husband and go with her lover.

It belongs to _Madhouse Cells_, because here Browning studies abnormal psychologies. The soliloquy consists in twelve five lines stanzas.

What makes P.L. particularly interesting is the detailed confession of the murderer, who obsessively reports every particular of the crime.

It can be divided into three parts

### Part 1
==**Line 1 to 5**==

> The rain set early in to-night,
>
> The sullen wind was soon awake,
>
> It tore the elm-tops down for spite,
>
> And did its worst to vex the lake:
>
> I listened with heart fit to break.
>
It’s a sort of prologue, with the description of the time of the day (late afternoon, merging into night) and the weather conditions, which are bad: it’s raining hard, and the wind is tearing the elm-tops.; the wind is also rising little waves on the lake.

The **gloomy weather** mirrors the psychological lability of the speaker, who listens to the noises of the external storm with a similar tempest in his heart.

The lover is in the cottage, waiting for Porphyria, the woman he passionately love, but of whose love is not sure.

### Part 2
==**Line 6 to 30**==

> When glided in Porphyria; straight
>
> She shut the cold out and the storm,
>
> And kneeled and made the cheerless grate
>
> Blaze up, and all the cottage warm;
>
> Which done, she rose, and from her form
>
> Withdrew the dripping cloak and shawl,
>
> And laid her soiled gloves by, untied
>
> Her hat and let the damp hair fall,
>
> And, last, she sat down by my side
>
> And called me. When no voice replied,
>
> She put my arm about her waist,
>
> And made her smooth white shoulder bare,
>
> And all her yellow hair displaced,
>
> And, stooping, made my cheek lie there,
>
> And spread, o’er all, her yellow hair,
>
> Murmuring how she loved me — she
>
> Too weak, for all her heart’s endeavour,
>
> To set its struggling passion free
>
> From pride, and vainer ties dissever,
>
> And give herself to me for ever.
>
> But passion sometimes would prevail,
>
> Nor could to-night’s gay feast restrain
>
> A sudden thought of one so pale
>
> For love of her, and all in vain:
>
> So, she was come through wind and rain.

We see the lady who arrives at the cottage, she glide in;
she is a lady, she is aristocratic, she is very rich, and her lover instead is of a lower class; even through she is a lady, she kneels in front of the fireplace, and she pokes the fire, which is dying out.

She takes off her wet cloak, her shawl and her gloves, and she let her damp hair fall.

She calls her lover, but he doesn’t reply, because he is angry and aggressive. She coaxes him, and she murmurs she loves him.

_Why is he so angry?_
Because he knows she is too proud and too weak to exchange the glittering world she belongs to for a humble life with him forever. In this moment her passion prevails, and she is happy and belongs to him.

### Part 3
==**Line 31-60**==

> Be sure I looked up at her eyes
>
> Happy and proud; at last I knew
>
> Porphyria worshipped me; surprise
>
> Made my heart swell, and still it grew
>
> While I debated what to do.
>
> That moment she was mine, mine, fair,
>
> Perfectly pure and good: I found
>
> A thing to do, and all her hair
>
> In one long yellow string I wound
>
> Three times her little throat around,
>
> And strangled her. ==No pain felt she==;

> I am quite sure she felt no pain.

>
> That all it scorned at once is fled,
>

>
> Porphyria’s love: she guessed not how
>
> Her darling one wish would be heard.
>
> And thus we sit together now,
>
> And all night long we have not stirred,
>
> And yet God has not said a word!

Here the crime occurs, and it is devoted to the lover, and to his joyful surprise when he realizes that Porphyria does love him.

_What can he do to detain this perfect moment?_
The answer of his deranged mind is that in order not to loose his possession **he must kill her**; by killing her she will be his forever.
He winds her hair around her slender neck three times and strangles her.

But madness is evident when he says “no pain felt she”, that reminds us of Othello’s words: “I would have thee linger in thy pain”.

When a person murders another person, especially in this condition, he thinks he is similar to God, because he has the power of life and death; Othello’s mind is deranged by jealousy, Lover’s one by madness: they both assume they are similar to God because they think they have a right to allot [assegnare, distribuire] death.

Now Porphyria is dead, she is in his arms, he opens her lids, he loosens her hair, and he kisses her repeatedly. He sicks all night long, without stirring, with her corps in his arms; the conclusion he draws is that **as God has said nothing, he has made a good action**.

Browning closes the poem with the line whose meaning is obscure. _Does he mean that madness is beyond God’s judgement?_ _Who can condemn a man who doesn’t know the boundaries between good and evil?_

After murdering the woman, the speaker feels he has complete power on her. The speaker is mentally alienated, he is cool and murderous, pitiless. It is a case of lucid insanity; the tone is cold and reflective.

## T: My Last Duchess
The poem is settled in Ferrara, when Alfonso II d’Este was the duke. It is set in the period of Italian Renaissance.

The speaker is the duke himself, but the real protagonist is her late wife; the silent listener is the ambassador of the Count of Tyrol.
_Why is he there?_ He has to define together with the duke the amount of the dowry that the Count of Tyrol’s daughter, who is promised to the Duke.

The Duke has had his previous wife killed, because she didn’t behave as well as he expected. Now he is going to marry an other lady, the Count of Tyrol’s Daughter, and he is defining the dowry that she will have to give him in order to became a duchess, since countess is lower than duchess.

The Duke is taking the Ambassador through his castle, to visit it, because he wants to impress him, in order to get a larger dowry: they are in front of a Canvas, which represents the Duchess, in all her youth and beauty.
There is this painting, hanging on a wall, representing the duchess. The Duke attitude while describing the paining is detached, cold, indifferent.

On _line 16_, in order to make the situation more realistic, the Duke quotes an imaginary monastic painter, in order to make the painting more precious in his listener’s eyes. The painter looks like the prototype of the Renaissance artist, working at the service of a patron.

The poem start abruptly, and there are colloquial elements: similar to an everyday speech.

>	_FERRARA_
>
>
>
> That’s my last Duchess painted on the wall,
>
> Looking as if she were alive. I call

> That piece a wonder, now; Fra Pandolf’s hands

>
> Her husband’s presence only, called that spot
>
> Of joy into the Duchess’ cheek; perhaps
>
> Fra Pandolf chanced to say, “Her mantle laps
>
> Over my lady’s wrist too much,” or “Paint
>

> Sir, ’twas all one! My favour at her breast,
>
> The dropping of the daylight in the West,
>
> The bough of cherries some officious fool
>
> Broke in the orchard for her, the white mule
>
> She rode with round the terrace—all and each
>
> Would draw from her alike the approving speech,
>
> Or blush, at least. She thanked men—good! but thanked
>
> Somehow—I know not how—as if she ranked
>
> My gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name
>
> With anybody’s gift. Who’d stoop to blame
>
> This sort of trifling? Even had you skill
>
> In speech—which I have not—to make your will
>
> Quite clear to such an one, and say, “Just this
>
> Or that in you disgusts me; here you miss,
>
> Or there exceed the mark”—and if she let
>
> Herself be lessoned so, nor plainly set
>
> Her wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse—
>
> E’en then would be some stooping; and I choose
>
> Never to stoop. Oh, sir, she smiled, no doubt,
>
> Whene’er I passed her; but who passed without
>
> Much the same smile? This grew; I gave commands;
>
> Then all smiles stopped together. There she stands
>
> As if alive. Will’t please you rise? We’ll meet
>
> The company below, then. I repeat,
>
> The Count your master’s known munificence
>
> Is ample warrant that no just pretense
>
> Of mine for dowry will be disallowed;
>
> Though his fair daughter’s self, as I avowed
>
> At starting, is my object. Nay, we’ll go
>
> Together down, sir. Notice Neptune, though,
>
> Taming a sea-horse, thought a rarity,
>
> Which Claus of Innsbruck cast in bronze for me!

This Duke is quite unusual.
The Duke is aware that Fra Pandolf’s works are motivated by flattery, and the Duke attitude toward flattery is sneering; but Fra Pandolf is also a pretest for the duke to introduce the duchess. In fact al the central part of the poem talks about her,

She ranked everything on the same level.

The Duke strongly disapproves on her behavior, but in spite of his disapproving words the Duke unconsciously reveals the duchess’s genuine outstanding  traits: she is good; in fact she was
* young
* naive
* full of life
* generous
* smiling
* wellcoming
* democratic, in the sense that she considerate all people on the same level
* openhearted and
*  warm,
* spontaneous
* delicate
* extrovert
* delightful

On the other hand the dukes opinion on her is that she was frivolous, superficial, gullible (too ready to believe); she was unaware of the honor imparted to her

The image that comes out is the one of a very young girl married to a much older man, which was a situation not so infrequent in renaissance courts.

At _line 34 to 43_ the attention is shifted from the Duchess to the Duke, who reveals his proud temper, by refusing to stoop

The poem now comes to his climx, on line 45-46, when he says “I gave commands; Then all smiles stopped together”; the duchess finally leaves the scene and disappear;
the Duke in fact dismiss her in a a few more word: “There she stands As if alive.” which repeats the line at the beginning: this enclose the tragic event in an imaginary framework.

The duchess has been killed, because her husband disliked her, but the way the duke produces this piece of information is indifferent, laconic, dry, cynical, casual and cold.

If the poem ended here, it would simply sound like the skillful narration of a dramatic episode, but it would be incomplete and unconvincing. It is in fact only the last 10 lines that provide a series of shocking revelations, essential to the understanding of the poem

We get to know that “the count your master” is the Count of Tyrol, “the company below” is a group of friends, so we infer the identity of the auditor, that is the ambassador of the Count of Tyrol, and the reasons for the marriage, that are the countess of Tyrol needs to improve in the social ladder, and the duke wants a new wife and money.

We also can infer the reason why the Duke told the auditor the tragic story of his last duchess; the reason is to warn the Countess of Tyrol not to behave as his former wife.

Considering that the poem is set in Renaissance Ferrara, and that it is possibly based on a real historical event, the Duke **might** be Alfonso d’Este, who had his first wife Lucrece to be killed after only three years of marriage.

After defining the personality of the duchess, we are able to point out the duke’s positive and negative connotations.

**Positive**:
* lover of the art, he loves beautiful things
* he is aristocratic
* he is a patron of the artist
* he’s a refined speaker

**Negative**:
* he is cruel
* possessive
* cynical
* ready to kill
* greedy (avid for power and money)
* self centered
* amoral
* feels entitled to allot death on his properties, which is something that only god is allowed to
* the duke’s true love is himself, and he considers his wife as a rightful pieces of property

# Alfred Tennyson
==p. 32-33 - V==

He was the fourth of ten children, and he was born in 1809. His father was the priest in a small village, and he is also a scholar and a man of great artistic taste; he had a well stocked library.
He was subject of depression and heavy drinking, but he took charge of the education of his children. Alfred boyhood was quite happy.

When he was 19 Alfred went to study at Trinity College, where he made friend with a brilliant young poet, Arthur Henry Hallam. But 4 years later financial problems compelled him to leave Cambridge, and he went back to his house, but his father died shortly afterwards; the family was allowed to stay into the rectory [casa del prete] for six more years.

In 1832, he traveled on the continent , with Hallam, and Hallam for that time had became engaged with one of Tennyson’s sisters; but in 1833 Hallam suddenly dies in Vienna, and his death proved a terrible blow for Terryson. For 17 years he continued to brood [portare il lutto] over it, and he eventually publish an elegy, dedicated to his friend, entitled _In memoriam HHH_, where he express his sorrow for his lost friend.

In 1850 it was a turning point in his life.
* He married his sweetheart; he had fallen in love with her four years before, but the marriage had always be forbidden by Emily’s father, because of the poet financial insecurity.
* He publish _In memoriam_, which set on him a seal of fame
* He is appointed Poet Laureate (the first after Worthwords).

Since 1850 his life was characterized by fame, money and success. In 1884 he was elevated to the peerage [members of the House of Lords in parliament]

He died in 1892, and was buried in the Poets’ Corner, in the Westminster abbey.

## Features of his works
Unlike Browning Tennyson was a real victorian writer; he was born on the same year as Darwin, and in a way he anticipated Darwin’s theories of evolution, although he was more concerned with the spiritual evolution of mankind than with the biological one.

* He was very much interested by science, and he was able to work out a compromise between science and religion, suggesting the progressive development of the human race, both through the succession of generations on Earth, and through the belief in a life after death
* He was interested in political and historical events, that changed the face of Europe, and he often found subjects for his poems among them.
* He was influenced by the grace and musicality of the romantics, in fact he was called a romantic of the third generation, but he was a true victorian when he emphasizes the importance of balance and discipline in form
* He was concerned with the social values of his time, and tried to face the great questions of his age, like family, patriotism, love and religion.
* He borrowed most of his themes from the Middle Ages, from classical antiquity and from old legends; he always added a personal note into them. This note was often melancholic.

## T: Ulysses

It is a celebration of the ancient hero, but Tennyson’s Ulysses is an old and tired king, who rules over an island inhabited by people who are only concerned with material life.
He has fought the long war of Troy; he has met dangers and adventures of any sorts and he has became famous all over the world for the idea of the horse.

Although he is old, and he guesses that little remains for him to live, he wants to set sails for the extreme adventure before death closes everything.

His adventure is spurred by his intention
> to follow knowledge like a sinking star;

this make him similar to Dante’s Ulysses, the hero that induced his companion to leave Ithaca, their families and their certainties
> per seguir virtute e canoscenza

Although he is old, he is ready to challenge the world, death and the unknown.
Unlike Dante’s Ulysses, he is not going to break a divine law, because the 19th century faith in science and in progress had long cancelled men’s fears of going beyond the limits imposed to men by God; Dante put Ulysses in hell because he had trespassed the limits imposed to men by God: the pillar of Hercules.

Ulysses becomes the expression of the dynamic man of Tennyson’s time, who believes he has the right and the duty to exploit all the possibilities of human intelligence.
From this point of view, he is contrasted to his own son Telemachus, who represents the balancing force of stability and conservation. Paradoxically Ulysses, who is the father, is more active of Telemachus who is the son and much younger.

Ulysses represents an active, adventurous life, rich in imagination and enthusiasm, though sometimes it seems like a sort of escape.

Telemachus represents a more sedentary life, full of responsibilities and social duties, though sometimes lacking in enthusiasm, with a more materialistic view.

The relationship between father and son is anyway healthy and strong, and based on mutual respect.

We can also say that Ulysses is the poet’s alter ego, because he gives expression to his torturing doubts about men’s destiny and men’s end role, and about life after death.

In general Ulysses became a metaphor for human existence, in which even the most optimistic vision of life - the one which interprets life as material and intellectual progress - is never separated from the melancholic awareness of the destiny of decline and death, reserved to us all.

The persona who is speaking is the king Ulysses, who is addressing his speech to his companions. Their presence is essential but passive, they are never interlocutors.
The character of Ulysses is rich and poignantly human; he is aware he has lived the best part of his life; he knows he has lost the integrity of his body and his energies, and he knows that death will soon put an end to everything. This gives a note of melancholy to the poem, and throws an ambiguous light on its immediate optimism.

The main sources of the monologue are Homer’s _Odyssey_ and Dante’s _Inferno_;
* Homer represents the perfect hero in the odyssey, who conquers troy, roams the whole world, came back to Ithaca and defeats all his enemies;
* Ulysses by Dante represents the tragic hero, who is punished for trying to learn to much, and goes beyond the limits of human knowledge; actually Dante puts Ulysses in hell for the sin of **fraud**, because of the deceit with the Trojan horse; moreover his passion for exploration has overcame his affection for his family. He is a multifarious character.

Ulysses by Tennyson represents the old hero who still wishes to travel and to learn, with a free heart and a free mind.

The first five lines are devoted to the description of Ulysses situation on Ithaca. He reveals dissatisfaction and contempt for his present life, which is boring and meaningless.; he expresses a deep nostalgia, a deep craving for his past adventures; there he is bored to death.

# The Brontë sisters

==p. 54 - V==

They are Charlotte, Emily and Anne, and they were the daughter of a priest, and their father have married a woman of delicate constitution who gave him 6 children before dying.

When he remained a widow, he asked his sister-in-law to come and help him; she was a very severe and austere woman, very cold and detached, and she came to look after the children, but in fact they were left much to themself.
They were usually alone, because mister Brontë was really egocentric and spent most of his days alone.

Four of the five girls were sent to a school for clergymen’s daughters, were the fees were very low, but the food was very bad and discipline was hard.
Here  the two eldest, Maria and Elizabeth, died, probably of tubercolosi, and after that Charlotte and Emily were brought back home.

There were 4 children left, and they were extremely precocious and clever; they spent their time in unmethodical study: they used to read and paint.

They went to Brussels, to study French and then come back.

Charlotte and Emily tried to open a school in their village, but they found no people.

In 1846 the three sisters jointly published at their expense, a collection of poems, but it attracted no attention. After that the three sisters devoted themself to the novel writing.

All of the Brontë brothers had a dramatic destiny; Anne died in 1849 at the age of 29; Emily died at 30,  on 1848; Patrick, who was a talented painter, died in 1848 after a dissolute life and charlotte died in 1855 at 39.

## Life and works
Charlotte (1816-55), Emily (1818-48) and Anne (1820-49) were the daughters of an Anglican clergyman of Irish origin, who had an important influence on their artistic inclinations. The Brontë sisters spent most of their life in isolation in a remote part of Yorkshire, in northern England. They did not receive a formal education. Apart from brief periods at school, they were mainly self educated, reading widely from their father’s library and drawing inspiration from the local public library or from periodicals. To express their intellectual creativity and their emotions, they began to write chronicles of imaginary countries and, in 1846, they published a volume of poetry, _Poems by Currer, Ellis and Acton_ Bell. Like many female writers of the period, they decided to use pseudonyms. It was under these pen names that each of the sisters published their novels the following year: Charlotte (Currer) published _Jane Eyre_, Emily (Ellis) _Wuthering Heights_, and Anne (Acton) _Agnes Grey_. Only Jane Eyre was immediately successful, and was followed by other two novels by Charlotte: _Shirley_ (1849) and _Villette_ (1853). The other two sisters soon died of consumption: Emily in 1848 and Anne in 1849. Charlotte married Reverend Arthur Bell Nicholls in 1854 and died the following year, probably of an illness due to pregnancy.

## Wuthering Heights

The novel start at the end of the story and then it is narrated in flashbacks.
This makes it a complex novel.
The atmosphere is gothic, nightmarish and unreal. The story goes backwards and forwards; the novel covers two generations of families, and it is linked by the character of Heathcliff.

There are two storytellers, Mr Lockwood and Nelly Dean, and there are three literary influences that acted on the novel:
* **romanticism**, because of the great role played by nature, that is nearly a co-protagonist; it is also romantic because Heathcliff is a _byronic hero_, that has a dark secret that chases and ruined his life;
* **realism**: it is mirrored in the social aspect of the novel; the features that are realistic are _the description of the settings_, _the conflict between two cultures_ and also _the complexity of the characters personality_;
* **gothic**: there is more of a touch of gothicism: nightmarish dream, the ghosts, superstition, prophecies

The novel closes with the reconciliation of the two spheres of the fantastic and the real.

The most important theme is the analysis of passion, that transcends the romantic conception of love, which here is strong and uncontrollable; it is similar to a natural force. It is both creative and destructive, nor sexual nor intellectual, but just an impulse, which binds together Catherine and Heathcliff: in fact they totally identify with each other.

Heathcliff is a romantic hero because of his aspiration toward a pure and complete identification with her. He represents the dynamic principle of the search of perfection against the static principle of acceptance of reality as it is

### Plot
The novel revolves around two houses, Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange, respectively inhabited by the Earnshaws and the Lintons. At the beginning of the story Mr Lockwood, the new tenant of Thrushcross Grange, visits his landlord, Mr Heathcliff, at Wuthering Heights. Forced to stay the night because of a snowstorm, Mr Lockwood has a strange dream about a girl, Catherine, who is tapping on the window, asking to be let in after 20 years of wandering on the moors. The next day Mr Lockwood returns to Thrushcross Grange and the housekeeper, Nelly Dean, tells him the whole story of the family from the Heights. Mr Earnshaw, the father of Hindley and Catherine, one day came back from Liverpool with a foundling, whom he called Heathcliff. Hindley ill-treated Heathcliff whereas Catherine got on very well with him. They roamed the moors together and promised they would stay together forever. One day Catherine was bitten by one of the Lintons’ dogs and was forced to spend five weeks at Thrushcross Grange to recover, which gave her the opportunity to get to know Edgar and Isabella, as well as their quiet and refined way of life. So when a few years later Edgar proposed to her, she accepted. She told Nelly Dean she would not marry Heathcliff because he was socially inferior. Heathcliff overheard part of the conversation and disappeared to return only three years later, handsome, rich and determined to take his revenge. He won the possession of Wuthering Heights gambling with Hindley, now a drunkard; then he eloped with Edgar’s sister, Isabella, married her and treated her like a servant. Catherine fell ill and died giving birth to a daughter, Cathy. Years later, Heathcliff kidnapped Cathy and obliged her to marry his weakly, spoilt son, Linton. His revenge was thus complete since he became the owner of Thrushcross Grange, too. Nelly’s narrative ends here. Mr Lockwood leaves Yorkshire and comes back after a year to find out that both Linton and Heathcliff are dead and Cathy and Hareton, Hindley’s son, are going to get married, to live in peace and happiness. Nelly tells Lockwood that there are rumours in the neighbourhood that the figures of a young man and woman have been seen wandering together in the moors.

### Themes
In the novel basic human emotions, such as love and hatred, are presented in a state of purity and concentration. The spirit of Romanticism and its concern with the human soul are still present in the correspondence between the violent passions of the characters and the wild natural landscape. Death is an important theme. Unlike other Victorian novels, where death is either a moment of forgiveness or the moment when all the conflicts are settled, in Wuthering Heights death is not an end, but a liberation of the spirit. The novel closes with the vision of the graveyard where Catherine and Heathcliff are buried, but the author is careful to say that they are sleeping, not dead. The Gothic elements in the novel, such as the sinister atmosphere of Wuthering Heights – surrounded by the wilderness –, Catherine’s ghost, and the dreams and superstitions often mentioned, are used not to frighten the reader, but to convey the struggle between the two opposed principles of love and hate, of order and chaos.

### Structure and style
The narrative mode is a system of Chinese boxes, a ‘concentric’ system of narratives. There are two major narrators, male and female, outsider and insider. Mr Lockwood, the polite visitor from the city, is the outsider; apart from a few occasions when he narrates what he sees, he simply writes down, in the form of a journal, what Nelly tells him. Nelly Dean is the second narrator, closely involved in the story and entirely reliable. Other characters occasionally narrate to Nelly. The narration does not proceed according to chronological time; it starts almost at the end of the story and develops a narrative within the narrative, including the use of flashbacks. This complex structure creates a sense of verisimilitude and, at the same time, a feeling of suspense. The continuous flowing of human life into the natural world creates moments of intense poetry and mysticism that are balanced by the concreteness and common sense of Nelly’s language. Wuthering Heights represents a unique achievement in Victorian literature. Often compared to a Shakespearean tragedy for its rendering of turbulent passions, unnatural crimes and cruelty, the novel marked a departure from the observation of society towards the description of the individual personality, and anticipated the novelists of the early 20th century in narrative technique.

### T: I am Heathcliff
==p. 65 - V==

In this part the narrator is Nelly Dean.
This passage is a sort of climax and a turning point in the story, for many reasons:
1. it strips out the kind of love that binds Catherine and Heathcliff, which is an uncontrollable love, that is beyond the limits of human understanding
2. it is based on a misunderstanding: Nelly Dean and Catherine are talking, and Catherine is opening her heart to the servant, and paradoxically and while she is listing the reasons why she is going to marry Edgar Lington, she fully reveals her love for Heathcliff. Heathcliff is eavesdropping the conversation but he doesn’t listen to the whole conversation, but only to the part in which she say why she couldn’t marry Heathcliff, and than he leaves on a misunderstanding
3. this is a turning point, since from now on Catherine falls ill for a long time, she nearly dies for heartbreak and she recovers and marries Edgar

==The first section, from line 1 to 55==

Catherine explains the reasons why she has decided to marry Edgar Linton: the reasons are underlined in pink; the words and phrases related to Catherine’s behavior are highlighted in pink. They denote an highly sensitive and emotional nature.

The reasons for marrying Edgar are the classical reasons for marrying a man; as Catherine goes on speaking, we realize her real motivations she is concerned with Heathcliff’s present condition of servitude due to her brother’s treatment of him. The real reason underneath the decision of marrying Edgar is to protect Heathcliff from her brother’s violence. Acquiring a higher social status, Catherine might help Heathcliff to improve his present conditions.

The words highlighted in light blue describes Nelly’s attitude: they are very rational and pragmatic; she encourages Catherine to reflects on the reasons and consequences of her choice .

==The second section, from line 56 to 93==
* There is Catherine dream: she tells a dream to Nelly Dean.
* Nelly is aware and conscious of Heathcliff presence outside the door, but Catherine is not. The confession starts.
* Catherine says that she loves Heathcliff’s and she compares the two men, with words related to heat and cold. The words referred to Edgar are cold, while Heathcliff lightning and fire.

==The third section, from line 94 to the end==

Here it’s dealt Catherine’s love for Heathcliff.
* At line 119 there is why she marries Edgar: “If I marry Linton,, I can aid Heathcliff to rise, and place him out of my brother’s power”

Catherine says she is a part of Heathcliff, she feels his pains, if he didn’t exist she wouldn’t have a reason to live. Their love seems to have nothing to do with sexual attraction or physical desire.
Their relationship is one of the soul, it is eternal and unchangeable, their love is concerned with the metaphysical and the impersonal.
The love’s nature is religious, not only in its mystiques but in the awareness of the incompleteness of all the elements that makes up human nature.
It’s absolute, romantic, intense and passionate.

#### Plot
Catherine speaks to Nelly in the kitchen. Neither of them is aware at first that Heathcliff is listening to their conversation. Catherine tells Nelly about Edgar’s marriage proposal and that she accepted. Nelly asks her if and why she loves Edgar, and she replies she does for a variety fo material reasons: he is rich, handsome and respectable. Nelly disapproves, and Catherine admits that she is doing the wrong thing. Then she tells Nelly that she had a dream in which she went to heaven and was unhappy there because she missed Wuthering Heights. She compares her marriage to Linton to being in heaven. She explains that, although she loves Heathcliff very much, she cannot marry him because Hindley has degraded him too much and she would be degraded too. Heathcliff leaves the room full of shame, humiliation and despair, and so he is not present to hear Catherine say that she loves him more deeply than anything else in the world.
Nelly emphasizes that Heathcliff would be deserted if she marries Linton, and Catherine indignantly replies that she is not going to desert Heathcliff, but will use her influence to raise him up in society She adds that they are such kindred spirits that they are the same person.

### About Heathcliff

Some details about the name "Heathcliff": it's formed by **heath**, _brughiera_, and **cliff**, which is _roccia scoscesa_;
* the denotation of the word **heath** is an area of open land where rough grass and heder grow, with few trees and bushes; the connotation of the word is wild character and love for freedom
* the denotation of **cliff** is a high area of rock with a steapside, and the connotation is strenght, loneliness and danger.

So Heathcliff is a particular character, we know that he is the outsider of the novel, and that his arrival triggers a series of dramatic events. We also get to know that he is a man uncontaminated by society, living in fusion with the world of nature.
Heathcliff is fears determined and wild.

He will have to disappear: at the end of the novel, he will die and also his son will not survive, because his name must disappear, for the future of the two families.
At the end of the novel the descendent of the two families will re-establish order and give life to **Thrushcross Grange**. This will happen after the death of Heathcliff and his son: harmony will be re-establish.

### T: Heathcliff's despair

==p. 70==

It's the moment in which Heathcliff get to know that Catherine has died by giving birth to her daughter Cathy, who was born from the marriage between Catherine and Linton.

Here Nelly Dean informs Heathcliff about the death of Catherine: the reaction is violente and terrible: he is destroyed and he cannot survive this by keeping his balance. At the beginning she is worried because she doesn't know what his reaction will be like.

He says
> ‘She’s dead!’ he said; ‘I’ve not waited for you to learn that. Put your handkerchief away – don’t  snivel before me. Damn you all! she wants none of your tears!’

Nelly Dean is sensitive, and she whips and she says
> we do sometimes pity creatures that have none of the feeling either for themselves or others

Heathcliff wants to know how she died, but moreover he wants to know if she has pronounced his name before she died; he is so disperate that when Nelly Dean says that she didn't mention him, Heathcliff curses Nelly Dean.

Catherine was his **life** and his **soul**: we get to know that Heathcliff feels exactly what Catherine declared before.

Nelly Dean is desperate, because she cannot help him, neither confort him, so she leaves.
Heathcliff acts like a wounded animal
> He dashed his head against the knotted trunk; and, lifting up his eyes, howled, not like a man, but like a savage beast being goaded to death with knives and spears.

From now on he will live in _torment_.

Also here we see that one of the most important themes of the novel is the theme of **opposing forces**: here there is the principle of storms and energy opposed to the principle of calm and settled assurance.
They are opposed but they are complementary: they ideally tend to unity.

Also in getting the news of Catherine death, Heathcliff reveals his character and the violence passion that live in him.

### Settings

The setting of Wuthering High is one of the protagonist's of the novel. We know that there are two places that are opposed to each other: Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange.
The fact that the novel takes the title from the first, means that that is the setting, and the other is its opposition.

_Wuthering Heights_ is described as a solitary, gloomy strong building: it is a place of the mind; it is the place Heathcliff and Catherine belongs to; which they try to leave and where they always return. _Thrushcross Grange_ is a place of order and normality; into _Wuthering Heights_ everything has a dramatic violence; they are Heaven and hell.

_Wuthering Heights_ is a metaphore of childhood, a place peopled with creatures of imagination, while _Thrushcross Grange_ is the place of adulthood.

We know that the characters of the novel belong to two generation of two different families: the Earnshaws, from Wuthering Heights, and the Lintons, that live in Thrushcross Grange. Heathcliff is a sort of link between the two families.

---

The novel is built around the contrast between the two houses on the Yorkshire moors: Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. Wuthering Heights is severe and gloomy, firmly rooted in local tradition and custom; it is the appropriate background for the life of unrestrained and primitive passion led by its owner, Heathcliff. Thrushcross Grange, the home of the bourgeois Lintons, reflects their conception of life, based on stability, kindness and respectability. So the two mansions stand for two opposing forces: the principle of storm and energy on the one hand, and the principle of calm and settled assurance on the other. Though opposed, they are complementary and ideally tend to unity. With the marriage between Hareton and Cathy, they will finally compose a harmony at the end of the novel, after the consummation of Heathcliff’s revenge and his death.

### The Byronic hero

The hero, Heathcliff, is described as a sort of ‘Byronic hero’, moved by irresistible passion, doomed to the despair of a solitary life and finally tending to a total identity with his love, Catherine. Yet, Heathcliff also appears as a Gothic villain in his inhuman treatment of his wife and even his son. Catherine is driven partly by her social ambitions, which finally lead her to marry Edgar, but she is also prompted to violate social conventions. She embodies a wild and Romantic nature.

---

Heathcliff is a Byronic hero.

The Byronic Hero is a moody, passionate, restless and misterious man, who hides some horrible sin or secret in his past. He is characterized by proud individualism, and rejects the conventional moral rules of society.

He is an outsider, isolated and attractive at the same time. He is of noble birth, but wild in his manners.

His looks are hard but handsome, and he has a great sensibility to nature and beauty.

Women cannot resist him, but he refuses his love. Men either admire him or envy him.

# Thomas Hardy

## Life
Thomas Hardy was born of humble parents at Higher Bockhampton, near Dorchester, in June 1840. As a boy he learned to play the violin, and he always loved music and dancing. He was also a voracious reader. When he left school in 1856, he was apprenticed to a local architect and church restorer. By 1862 he was working and studying architecture in London, and he began to write poetry. He also read the works of Comte, Mill, Darwin and Schopenhauer. In 1872 he published a novel, _Under the Greenwood Tree_, but he gained fame thanks to _Far from the Madding Crowd_, which appeared in serial form throughout 1874 in the monthly issues of _The Cornhill Magazine_. After this success he devoted his life to writing. His second great work of fiction was _The Return of the Native_, followed by a sequence of four remarkable tragic novels: _The Mayor of Casterbridge_, _The Woodlanders_, _Tess of the D'Urbervilles_ and his last one, _Jude the Obscure_.
This book scandalized Victorian public opinion with its pessimism and immorality; one copy was even burnt publicly by a bishop. After publishing _Wessex poems_, Hardy decided to give up fiction and turn to poetry. He died in 1928.

## Features

The production is large, he wrote a lot of novels: he is called a **late victorian novelist**, and he was a prolific writer.
He has been defined a
* pessimist
* realist
* romantic
* naturalist
* **regionalist**

His regionalism is strictly connected to the limited area where he set his novels, which he called _Wessex_

In anglosasson time, ==Wessex== was one of the seven kingdoms established in Britain: originally it covered the south western part of the country, between the Times and the south coast. It's the present Dorsetshire.

Hardy justify the adoption of the word Wessex by the need to give territorial definition to his novels. Wessex became the unifying element and a link between past and present, proving the ideal setting for novels whose major theme was the transformation of an agricultural society under the impact of modern industrial life.

This total immersion in ==nature==, together with a belief that only in rural life can man fully express their passions, makes Hardy in some respect a **romantic writer**.
While for the romantic nature usually meant joy and consolation for Hardy it was a hostile power, indifferent to men's destiny.

==Love==, which is present in all novels it is an other _romantic theme_, quiet often finishes in disillusion and failure, destroyed by institutions like **marriage** or by **society**, or by chance.

He was quite pessimistic, but his ==pessimism== was linked to the intellectual and scientific movement of the time, and to his studies of Darwin and Mills. His **religious faith** disappeared, and he rejected Cristian Faith and _the Bible_. He worked out a pessimistic theory according to which man is an insignificant object in a universe which is _indifferent to him_. Man is a **powerless victim** of an _obscure faith_, which shows its workings in a series of accidents and coincidences.

This fatalistic determinism seemed to deprive man of all responsibilities for his actions. Hardy elaborated the idea of a kind of ==predestination==, quite often a predestination to failure, according to which all men fulfill their destiny with no help from society, which oppresses and destroys them, or from love, which usually leads to unhappiness

Hardy felt compassion for suffering people, and for all living creatures. His ==characters== although failing when they try to improve themselves, maintain a dignity of their own. Around them, moves the community, made of people unable to provide help.

The ==tenchnique== he uses is architectural and cinematic: he was very good at _givig unity_ to his novels, although the plots are not always convincing because of certain melodramatic episodes and coincidences. It is **cinematic** because it starts with a panoramic effect and until he provides a close-up on a single detail.

## ==Novel==: Tess D'Urberville

This novel has a subtitle, that is

        A Pure Woman Faithfully Presented

With this subtitle Hardy wanted to say that a woman forced by circumstances to submit to violence and to use violence can still be ==pure==. Although she has used and received violence, she can still be called pure, in her heart. This was an open challenge to the moral conventions of the time. In the victorian age, women were Angels or a Whores. There was no possibility in the middle. By saying she is a pure woman, he challenged the moral conventions of the time.

We must say that the ==inner structure== of the novel is formed by conflicts and antagonism; for example _prejudice_ is opposed to _feelings_, _culture_ vs _ignorance_, _individual_ vs _community_ and _human will_ vs _destiny_. All the novel is built around these opposites.

The idea that underlies the whole novel is that ==man is the victim== of the decisions and choices forced on him by predestination. We are born and our destiny is already predetermined.

This was very well said in ==Macbeth==: in the end there is _A tale told by an idiot_, in which Macbeth says that choosing in life is just an illusion, but everything is already predetermined, and every step we take in a direction with the illusion of choosing freely leads us exactly towards the goal that a Might-being or God, or fate or chance had predetermined for us. Shakespeare says that man is given the illusion to choose but actually he is just a puppet in the hands of his destiny.

The conclusion of the novel is tragic and melodramatic and the ==plot== is imbued with fatalism and pessimism.

### Plot
* ==p. 99==

John Durbeyfield, a peddler who lives in the village of **Marlott**, discovers he is a descendent of a rich and aristocratic family, the D'Urbervilles. His family has already fallen on hard times and the situation gets worse when their horse, which is their only means of sustenance, dies. Thereforse his eldest daughter Tess is persuaded to go to the village of **Trantridge** and to start working as a poultry maid on the D'Urberville estate. She resists her master Alec's attempts to seduce her. Finally he takes advantage of her in the woods one night after a fair. Later she finds herself pregnant. She returns to her village and gives birth to a baby boy who died soon after. She leaves her father's house and goes to a distant valley, where she accepts a job as a milkmaid at **Talboathays Dairy** in a rich agricultural region of southern England. There she meets Angel Clare, a clergyman's son who is interested in new farming methods. They fall in love but Tess feels she should tell Angel about her past. She writes him a confessional note and slips it under his door, but it slides under the carpet and Angel never sees it. They get married but when, on their wedding night, Tess tells Angel about her past, he leaves her and goes to Brazil.
She bears great sufferings and hardship and is forced to take a job at **Flintcombe Ash**, a barren region where she works in the fields in winter. She hears a wandering preacher speak and discovers that he is Alec D'Urberville, who has been converted to Christianity by Angel's father, Reverend Clare. Tess finally agree to become Alec's mistress and lives in the seaside resort of Sandbourne. Angel comes back from Brazil, finds her and tells her he has forgiven her.
Out of despair, Tess kills Alec and flees with Angel. She is arrested at **Stonehenge** while she is sleeping on the sone of sacrifice, and she is finally executed.

### Themes

1. **Nature** is a coprotagonist but it is indifferent to men's destiny (as Leopardi says)
2. **Influence of social laws** and conventions on the individual. Hardy says that the life of an individual, of a human being follows the same pattern *as* all natural things, so it is subjected to growth and decay. It has a short season of joy than it falls into despair. In this specific case Tess is a particular specimen of woman: she wishes to live despite the wounds that life has inflicted on her. She she is continuously regenerated; she dies in herself and than she reborns.
3. **Society and morality** contrasted to the **indifference of nature**.
4. **Chance** (anche detto _hap_). Tess' destiny is determined by the combination of several factors.
    1. It is inherent in her condition of human being, and brings with itself the inevitability of sufference and death
    2. Pressure of social forces that determine the future of a person from birth. These conditions are
        * **sex**: she is a female. As a woman of her times she inherits the tendency to accept other people's will *passively*, and she will be destroyed because of this.
        * **family**: she was born from a very poor family
        * **beauty**: she is born extremely beautiful; nowadays it is something positive, but for Tess this is a bad omen
        * **causal circumstances** contribute to the building of her destiny: for example the death of her father horse, which is the only wealth of the family, and the letter not read by Angel before their wedding
5. **Religion**, which is very important. Hardy refuses christianity, so Angel refuses the christian faith of his family because it can no longer answer to the needs of modern man. Only the primitive worship of nature, for example the celebration of druids in Stonehenge (considered the temple of the sun), seems to find an inner response in the heart of unsophisticated and innocente creatures like Tess.
6. **Progress**. Hardy believes that the rural countryside shouldn't be spoilt by the effects of industrialization; for example the life of the village where Tess lives is upset by the arrival of the railway.

### T: Alec and Tess
* ==p. 100==

==Tess's father=='s horse has died, and her father has discovered that his family belongs to a branch of the D'Urbervilles family, and that he has some rich relatives. The "D" in front of the name is like "von". Tess's family is poor, and they are fallen, and they have no more privileges. He discovers that he has rich relatives. He is a very low character, he drinks a lot and is very violent, and moreover he continuously bear children, and they are a big family

When the horse die, he sends his elder daughter to ==work in the farm== of this rich relative, but unfortunately here there is an older cousin. Her father expect her to work in the farm, with a good activity, but instead she becomes a poultry maid, but from the very beginning Alec wants to seduce her, since she is extremely beautiful

The ==first occasion== takes place one night, it is September evening, and she is coming back from the farm on foot. She is an outcast in the group of workers, because the girls think she is too beautiful and they are envious. The boys all wants to seduce her, and she refuses them. So she is isolated. By chance (and chance is always present) Alec, coming with his horse, asks her if she wants a lift. She accept, since she is very tired and because the others don't want her, and also because it is also an act of submission to someone much richer. Alec and Tess ride through the forest and at certain moment she realizes that he has taken the wrong turn, but it is too late.

#### First part: 1-45

> She was silent, and the horse ambled along for a considerable distance, till a faint luminous fog, which had hung in the hollows all the evening, became general and enveloped them. It seemed to hold the moonlight in suspension, rendering it more pervasive than in clear air. Whether on this account, or from absent-mindedness, or from sleepiness, she did not perceive that they had long ago passed the point at which the lane to Trantridge branched from the highway, and that her conductor had not taken the Trantridge track.
>
>She was inexpressibly weary. [...] Only once, however, was she overcome by actual drowsiness. In that moment of oblivion her head sank gently against him.
>
>D’Urberville stopped the horse, withdrew his feet from the stirrups, turned sideways on the saddle, and enclosed her waist with his arm to support her.
>
>This immediately put her on the defensive, and with one of those sudden impulses of reprisal to which she was liable she gave him a little push from her. In his ticklish position he nearly lost his balance and only just avoided rolling over into the road, the horse, though a powerful one, being fortunately the quietest he rode.
>
>“That is devilish unkind!” he said. “I mean no harm—only to keep you from falling.”
>
>She pondered suspiciously, till, thinking that this might after all be true, she relented, and said quite humbly, “I beg your pardon, sir.”
>
>“I won’t pardon you unless you show some confidence in me. Good God!” he burst out, “what am I, to be repulsed so by a mere chit like you? For near three mortal months have you trifled with my feelings, eluded me, and snubbed me; and I won’t stand it!”
>
>“I’ll leave you to-morrow, sir.”
>
>“No, you will not leave me to-morrow! Will you, I ask once more, show your belief in me by letting me clasp you with my arm? Come, between us two and nobody else, now. We know each other well; and you know that I love you, and think you the prettiest girl in the world, which you are. Mayn’t I treat you as a lover?”
>
>She drew a quick pettish breath of objection, writhing uneasily on her seat, looked far ahead, and murmured, “I don’t know—I wish—how can I say yes or no when—”
>
>He settled the matter by clasping his arm round her as he desired, and Tess expressed no further negative. Thus they sidled slowly onward till it struck her they had been advancing for an unconscionable time—far longer than was usually occupied by the short journey from Chaseborough, even at this walking pace, and that they were no longer on hard road, but in a mere trackway.
>
>“Why, where be we?” she exclaimed.
>
>“Passing by a wood.”
>
>“A wood—what wood? Surely we are quite out of the road?”
>
>“A bit of The Chase—the oldest wood in England. It is a lovely night, and why should we not prolong our ride a little?”
>
>“How could you be so treacherous!” said Tess, between archness and real dismay, and getting rid of his arm by pulling open his fingers one by one, though at the risk of slipping off herself. “Just when I’ve been putting such trust in you, and obliging you to please you, because I thought I had wronged you by that push! Please set me down, and let me walk home.”
>
>“You cannot walk home, darling, even if the air were clear. We are miles away from Trantridge, if I must tell you, and in this growing fog you might wander for hours among these trees.”

It is shown different stages of mind she is going through
1. absent mindedness
2. weariness
3. uneasiness
4. indignation
5. embarassment

During the ride ==Alec takes advantage== of his position, in the sense that he makes advances to her: he keeps her close to him and he's very tender and affectionate. Tess is not in the position to reject Alec advances, and she even feels guilty for her treatment of him, because he is her master and she will discover that he has been giving her family some gifts:
* an horse for her father
* toys for the children

Alec and Tess ride the horse in close ==proximity==, and this is an anticipation of the sexual act. She has a moment of oblivion, a moment in which she is not able to act consciously, and he goes deeper into the forest, and then she get angry.
When she realizes this, she wants to go home, but he denies this. He promises her he will go up the hill in order to understand where they are.
They stop in a place and he prepares a nest for her. He goes away up the hill.

#### Second part: 45-105

>“Never mind that,” she coaxed. “Put me down, I beg you. I don’t mind where it is; only let me get down, sir, please!”
>
>“Very well, then, I will—on one condition. Having brought you here to this out-of-the-way place, I feel myself responsible for your safe-conduct home, whatever you may yourself feel about it. As to your getting to Trantridge without assistance, it is quite impossible; for, to tell the truth, dear, owing to this fog, which so disguises everything, I don’t quite know where we are myself. Now, if you will promise to wait beside the horse while I walk through the bushes till I come to some road or house, and ascertain exactly our whereabouts, I’ll deposit you here willingly. When I come back I’ll give you full directions, and if you insist upon walking you may; or you may ride—at your pleasure.”
>
>She accepted these terms, and slid off on the near side, though not till he had stolen a cursory kiss. He sprang down on the other side.
>
>“I suppose I must hold the horse?” said she.
>
>“Oh no; it’s not necessary,” replied Alec, patting the panting creature. “He’s had enough of it for to-night.”
>
>He turned the horse’s head into the bushes, hitched him on to a bough, and made a sort of couch or nest for her in the deep mass of dead leaves.
>
>“Now, you sit there,” he said. “The leaves have not got damp as yet. Just give an eye to the horse—it will be quite sufficient.”
>
>He took a few steps away from her, but, returning, said, “By the bye, Tess, your father has a new cob to-day. Somebody gave it to him.”
>
>“Somebody? You!”
>
>D’Urberville nodded.
>
>“O how very good of you that is!” she exclaimed, with a painful sense of the awkwardness of having to thank him just then.
>
>“And the children have some toys.”
>
>“I didn’t know—you ever sent them anything!” she murmured, much moved. “I almost wish you had not—yes, I almost wish it!”
>
>“Why, dear?”
>
>“It—hampers me so.”
>
>“Tessy—don’t you love me ever so little now?”
>
>“I’m grateful,” she reluctantly admitted. “But I fear I do not—” The sudden vision of his passion for herself as a factor in this result so distressed her that, beginning with one slow tear, and then following with another, she wept outright.
>
>“Don’t cry, dear, dear one! Now sit down here, and wait till I come.” She passively sat down amid the leaves he had heaped, and shivered slightly. “Are you cold?” he asked.
>
>“Not very—a little.”
>
>He touched her with his fingers, which sank into her as into down. “You have only that puffy muslin dress on—how’s that?”
>
>“It’s my best summer one. ’Twas very warm when I started, and I didn’t know I was going to ride, and that it would be night.”
>
>“Nights grow chilly in September. Let me see.” He pulled off a light overcoat that he had worn, and put it round her tenderly. “That’s it—now you’ll feel warmer,” he continued. “Now, my pretty, rest there; I shall soon be back again.”
>
>Having buttoned the overcoat round her shoulders he plunged into the webs of vapour which by this time formed veils between the trees. She could hear the rustling of the branches as he ascended the adjoining slope, till his movements were no louder than the hopping of a bird, and finally died away. With the setting of the moon the pale light lessened, and Tess became invisible as she fell into reverie upon the leaves where he had left her.
>
>In the meantime Alec d’Urberville had pushed on up the slope to clear his genuine doubt as to the quarter of The Chase they were in. He had, in fact, ridden quite at random for over an hour, taking any turning that came to hand in order to prolong companionship with her, and giving far more attention to Tess’s moonlit person than to any wayside object. A little rest for the jaded animal being desirable, he did not hasten his search for landmarks. A clamber over the hill into the adjoining vale brought him to the fence of a highway whose contours he recognized, which settled the question of their whereabouts. D’Urberville thereupon turned back; but by this time the moon had quite gone down, and partly on account of the fog The Chase was wrapped in thick darkness, although morning was not far off. He was obliged to advance with outstretched hands to avoid contact with the boughs, and discovered that to hit the exact spot from which he had started was at first entirely beyond him. Roaming up and down, round and round, he at length heard a slight movement of the horse close at hand; and the sleeve of his overcoat unexpectedly caught his foot.
>
>“Tess!” said d’Urberville.
>
>There was no answer. The obscurity was now so great that he could see absolutely nothing but a pale nebulousness at his feet, which represented the white muslin figure he had left upon the dead leaves. Everything else was blackness alike. D’Urberville stooped; and heard a gentle regular breathing. He knelt and bent lower, till her breath warmed his face, and in a moment his cheek was in contact with hers. She was sleeping soundly, and upon her eyelashes there lingered tears.

Tess experiences more states of mind:
1. distress
2. helplessness

What makes us understand that she is a _victorian girl_ is that she doesn't leave when he goes away. She would have the possibility to get up and run away; every clever girl would have understood what his purpose was, and would have gone away.

> She passively sat down amid the leaves he had heaped, and shivered slightly

* This part highlights the most important trait of Tess's character, which is ==passivity==: she is passive to the will of a man and of a master.

There is an other symbol: ==Tess's muslin dress== which represents her fragile innocence.

The ==fog== is the symbol of Alec behavior: Alec is not behaving in a clear decorous way. He gets back and he is able to find her because of the colour of the dress.

> She was sleeping soundly, and upon her eyelashes there lingered tears.
* She was sleeping and there were tears on her face; we get to know that she had cried because she knew what was going to happen, and the tears were still on her eyelashes.

#### Third part: 106-125

> Darkness and silence ruled everywhere around. Above them rose the primaeval yews and oaks of The Chase, in which there poised gentle roosting birds in their last nap; and about them stole the hopping rabbits and hares. But, might some say, where was Tess’s guardian angel? where was the providence of her simple faith? Perhaps, like that other god of whom the ironical Tishbite spoke, he was talking, or he was pursuing, or he was in a journey, or he was sleeping and not to be awaked.

* many details of the wood are shown, which make us understand that nature is indifferent and society does not wish to know or understand.
* The ==act of seduction== is not described, but we get to know that it has taken place, because Hardy talks about Tess's guardian angel, which was absent: this denies the possibility of relying on religion

>Why it was that upon this beautiful feminine tissue, sensitive as gossamer, and practically blank as snow as yet, there should have been traced such a coarse pattern as it was doomed to receive; why so often the coarse appropriates the finer thus, the wrong man the woman, the wrong woman the man, many thousand years of analytical philosophy have failed to explain to our sense of order. One may, indeed, admit the possibility of a retribution lurking in the present catastrophe. Doubtless some of Tess d’Urberville’s mailed ancestors rollicking home from a fray had dealt the same measure even more ruthlessly towards peasant girls of their time. But though to visit the sins of the fathers upon the children may be a morality good enough for divinities, it is scorned by average human nature; and it therefore does not mend the matter.
>
>As Tess’s own people down in those retreats are never tired of saying among each other in their fatalistic way: “It was to be.” There lay the pity of it. An immeasurable social chasm was to divide our heroine’s personality thereafter from that previous self of hers who stepped from her mother’s door to try her fortune at Trantridge poultry-farm.

The narrator addresses the reader directly, and he makes this by putting the activities of the human being into the contest of nature and of supernatural power. He talks about the birds and animals in the wood going about their business, than he considers that the past affects the present. He states that man's life is regulated by **chance**.

> An immeasurable social chasm
* makes reference that Tess and Alec came from two different social classes, and that their relationship is not acceptable to either classes, moreover it is the woman who pays the price of the lost of reputation: she is a fallen woman. From this moment on she will no longer be simple and joyful, but will have a darker side to her personality.

==Tess is not responsible== and Hardy always presents her as a victim

### T: Tess's baby
* ==p. 104==

After the seduction the ==relationship== goes on, and he visits her bedroom every night; he seems to be in love with her: she is his mistress.

Tess gets ==pregnant== and she decides to leave the farm; she never says anything to Alec, and he doesn't know she is pregnant.

She keeps her ==child== with her and goes to work to the field: this is a very hard work, much harder than in Alec's farm. She is only interested in her child: the baby has never been baptized, because she had him outside the marriage.

When the child is three years old she left him to the care of her family to go to work; the baby ==falls ill==, and her family is unable to look after him. They let him **die**, also because he was a burden. She has to **bury him**.

She goes to the priest and asks him to ==baptize== the baby before burying him, since unbaptized children go to hell, and she is worried. The vicar tells her that he is not going to baptize the child, so she decides to baptize the child herself.

The parson experiment a ==conflict== between his feeling and his nature **as a man** and his duties as a **clergyman**.

Hardy wants to underline that ==religion== is **no longer capable** of fulfilling the needs of modern man, because rules are too strict.

The passage can be divided into four parts:

#### First part: 1-16

>“Be you really going to christen him, Tess?”
>
>The girl-mother replied in a grave affirmative.
>
>“What’s his name going to be?”
>
>She had not thought of that, but a name suggested by a phrase in the book of Genesis came into her head as she proceeded with the baptismal service, and now she pronounced it:
>
>“SORROW, I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.”
>
>She sprinkled the water, and there was silence.
>
>“Say ‘Amen,’ children.”
>
>The tiny voices piped in obedient response, “Amen!”
>
>Tess went on:
>
>“We receive this child”—and so forth—“and do sign him with the sign of the Cross.”
>
>Here she dipped her hand into the basin, and fervently drew an immense cross upon the baby with her forefinger, continuing with the customary sentences as to his manfully fighting against sin, the world, and the devil, and being a faithful soldier and servant unto his life’s end. She duly went on with the Lord’s Prayer, the children lisping it after her in a thin gnat-like wail, till, at the conclusion, raising their voices to clerk’s pitch, they again piped into silence, “Amen!” [...]

There is the baptism: Tess performs the ceremony by herself with her brothers and sisters, and call the baby Sorrow. This baptism is a baptism for Tess as well, and marks a new sense-worth she lacked.

#### Second part: 17-25

>Poor Sorrow’s campaign against sin, the world, and the devil was doomed to be of limited brilliancy—luckily perhaps for himself, considering his beginnings. In the blue of the morning that fragile soldier and servant breathed his last, and when the other children awoke they cried bitterly, and begged Sissy to have another pretty baby. [...]
>
>So passed away Sorrow the Undesired—that intrusive creature, that bastard gift of shameless Nature, who respects not the social law; a waif to whom eternal Time had been a matter of days merely, who knew not that such things as years and centuries ever were; to whom the cottage interior was the universe, the week’s weather climate, new-born babyhood human existence, and the instinct to suck human knowledge.

The description of Sorrow's death and the obtrusive narrator's comments on his unlucky and short life. In this part there is also the contrast between Sorrow's short and meaningless life and the eternity and vastity of the universe, and also the contrast between the baby's existence and the refusal opposed by society.

#### Third part: 26-58

>Tess, who mused on the christening a good deal, wondered if it were doctrinally sufficient to secure a Christian burial for the child. Nobody could tell this but the parson of the parish, and he was a new-comer, and did not know her. [...]
>
>“I should like to ask you something, sir.”
>
>He expressed his willingness to listen, and she told the story of the baby’s illness and the extemporized ordinance. “And now, sir,” she added earnestly, “can you tell me this—will it be just the same for him as if you had baptized him?”
>
>Having the natural feelings of a tradesman at finding that a job he should have been called in for had been unskilfully botched by his customers among themselves, he was disposed to say no. Yet the dignity of the girl, the strange tenderness in her voice, combined to affect his nobler impulses—or rather those that he had left in him after ten years of endeavour to graft technical belief on actual scepticism. The man and the ecclesiastic fought within him, and the victory fell to the man.
>
>“My dear girl,” he said, “it will be just the same.”
>
>“Then will you give him a Christian burial?” she asked quickly.
>
>The Vicar felt himself cornered. Hearing of the baby’s illness, he had conscientiously gone to the house after nightfall to perform the rite, and, unaware that the refusal to admit him had come from Tess’s father and not from Tess, he could not allow the plea of necessity for its irregular administration.
>
>“Ah—that’s another matter,” he said.
>
>“Another matter—why?” asked Tess, rather warmly.
>
>“Well—I would willingly do so if only we two were concerned. But I must not—for certain reasons.”
>
>“Just for once, sir!”
>
>“Really I must not.”
>
>“O sir!” She seized his hand as she spoke.
>
>He withdrew it, shaking his head.
>
>“Then I don’t like you!” she burst out, “and I’ll never come to your church no more!”
>
>“Don’t talk so rashly.”
>
>“Perhaps it will be just the same to him if you don’t?... Will it be just the same? Don’t for God’s sake speak as saint to sinner, but as you yourself to me myself—poor me!”
>
>How the Vicar reconciled his answer with the strict notions he supposed himself to hold on these subjects it is beyond a layman’s power to tell, though not to excuse. Somewhat moved, he said in this case also—
>
>“It will be just the same.”

Here there is Tess and the Vicar; she asks him if the baby has the right to be buried in holy ground, in the cemetery.

#### Fourth part: 59-68

>So the baby was carried in a small deal box, under an ancient woman’s shawl, to the churchyard that night, and buried by lantern-light, at the cost of a shilling and a pint of beer to the sexton, in that shabby corner of God’s allotment where He lets the nettles grow, and where all unbaptized infants, notorious drunkards, suicides, and others of the conjecturally damned are laid. In spite of the untoward surroundings, however, Tess bravely made a little cross of two laths and a piece of string, and having bound it with flowers, she stuck it up at the head of the grave one evening when she could enter the churchyard without being seen, putting at the foot also a bunch of the same flowers in a little jar of water to keep them alive. What matter was it that on the outside of the jar the eye of mere observation noted the words “Keelwell’s Marmalade”? The eye of maternal affection did not see them in its vision of higher things.

The baby is finally buried in a forgotten part of the churchyard among the unbaptized, the drunkard and the suicides: the damned.

Tess is making a crusade against society.

## ==Novel==: Jude the Obscure

### Plot

Jude Fawley, an orphan boy from a poor village, has ambitions to become a student at the University of Christminster, which Hardy modelled on Oxford with its beautiful colleges. Jude works as a stonemason and studies in his free time.
After his marriage to Arabella Donn ends disastrously, he moves to Christminster where he hopes to fulfil his dream and where he meets his cousin Sue Bridehead.
He arranges for her to work with the town schoolmaster, Richard Phillotson. She soon gets engaged to Phillotson and marries him After a while Sue and Jude meet again and he finds out that she is not happy in her marriage. They fall in love and decide to live together, but they refuse the institution of marriage. Sue takes in Jude's son, called Little Father Time, who was born from his first marriage, and bears Jude a son and a daughter.
This scandalous relationship provokes the disapproval of the narrow minded people of the university town. It is also subjected to the pressures of poverty because Jude loses his job. They cannot find lodging, so Sue and the children live in a room while Jude stays at a tavern. The climax is reached with the death of their children ( T78). Sue thinks that this is God's punishment for their relationship and goes back to Phillotson, while Jude lives with Arabella again but dies soon after.

### Settings

The novel is divided into six parts; each is set in a particular town or village.

**Part I** is set in Marygreen, where young Jude develops a passionate desire for a university education.
**Part II** is centred in Christminster, where Jude finds that access to university is impossible for a working-class man.
**Part III** takes place in Melchester, where Jude aims to study for the church, in the hope of entering a theological college. **Part IV** is staged in Shaston, where Sue asks Phillotson for her freedom and returns to Jude.
**Part V** is mainly set in Aldbrickham, where Sue and Jude finally agree to live together. They have to leave and move from one town to another, because of gossip and social disapproval.
**Part VI** marks the return to Christminster, where tragedy takes place.

### Themes

In the novel Hardy questions the **sanctity of marriage vows** and shows his interest in the issue of **divorce**. Another contemporary issue is that of higher education for the working class. Through the character of Sue, Hardy hints at the development of a new figure of woman who has been denied autonomy and is struggling for independence of thought and action.

### Style

The plot is based on a **symmetrical pattern** of marriage, desertion, divorce and final remarriage. The novel represents a departure from Victorianism with its portrayal of weakened vitality and grey despair, in a bleak urban setting characterized by a **sense of anxiety** and **self-destruction**. Although Hardy uses the **third-person omniscient narrator**, he denies him the possibility to explain and interpret things by focusing on the relationship between Jude and Sue, and developing the story through the characters' **repetitive dialogues**. In this way he anticipates the modern novel by means of a **two-voiced process of analysis** of the human psyche which differs both from the stream of consciousness and the interior monologue.

### T: Little Father Time

#### First part: 1-15

**Jude's discovery of the little corpses.**

>Jude stood bending over the kettle, with his watch in his hand, timing the eggs, so that his back was turned to the little inner chamber where the children lay. A shriek from Sue suddenly caused him to start round. He saw that the door of the room, or rather closet—which had seemed to go heavily upon its hinges as she pushed it back—was open, and that Sue had sunk to the floor just within it. Hastening forward to pick her up he turned his eyes to the little bed spread on the boards; no children were there. He looked in bewilderment round the room. At the back of the door were fixed two hooks for hanging garments, and from these the forms of the two youngest children were suspended, by a piece of box-cord round each of their necks, while from a nail a few yards off the body of little Jude was hanging in a similar manner. An overturned chair was near the elder boy, and his glazed eyes were slanted into the room; but those of the girl and the baby boy were closed.
>
>Half-paralyzed by the strange and consummate horror of the scene, he let Sue lie, cut the cords with his pocket-knife and threw the three children on the bed; but the feel of their bodies in the momentary handling seemed to say that they were dead. He caught up Sue, who was in fainting fits, and put her on the bed in the other room, after which he breathlessly summoned the landlady and ran out for a doctor.

Hardy uses a ==cinematic tecnique==. Jude is virtually converted into a camera focusing on the main object followed by details. This is highlighted in yellow

There is ==Jude's== immediate ==reaction== to the scene (highlighted in purple). There is a very fast rhythm

#### Second part: 16-31

**Sue's despair**

>When he got back Sue had come to herself, and the two helpless women, bending over the children in wild efforts to restore them, and the triplet of little corpses, formed a sight which overthrew his self-command. The nearest surgeon came in, but, as Jude had inferred, his presence was superfluous. The children were past saving, for though their bodies were still barely cold it was conjectured that they had been hanging more than an hour. The probability held by the parents later on, when they were able to reason on the case, was that the elder boy, on waking, looked into the outer room for Sue, and, finding her absent, was thrown into a fit of aggravated despondency that the events and information of the evening before had induced in his morbid temperament. Moreover a piece of paper was found upon the floor, on which was written, in the boy’s hand, with the bit of lead pencil that he carried:
>
>     Done because we are too menny.
>
>At sight of this Sue’s nerves utterly gave way, an awful conviction that her discourse with the boy had been the main cause of the tragedy, throwing her into a convulsive agony which knew no abatement. They carried her away against her wish to a room on the lower floor; and there she lay, her slight figure shaken with her gasps, and her eyes staring at the ceiling, the woman of the house vainly trying to soothe her.

==Her reactions== are opposite to Jude's in the sense that she breaks down and cannot find consolation (highlighted in green).

#### Third part: 32-50

**Doctor's explanation**

>They could hear from this chamber the people moving about above, and she implored to be allowed to go back, and was only kept from doing so by the assurance that, if there were any hope, her presence might do harm, and the reminder that it was necessary to take care of herself lest she should endanger a coming life. Her inquiries were incessant, and at last Jude came down and told her there was no hope. As soon as she could speak she informed him what she had said to the boy, and how she thought herself the cause of this.
>
>“No,” said Jude. “It was in his nature to do it. The Doctor says there are such boys springing up amongst us—boys of a sort unknown in the last generation—the outcome of new views of life. They seem to see all its terrors before they are old enough to have staying power to resist them. He says it is the beginning of the coming universal wish not to live. He’s an advanced man, the Doctor: but he can give no consolation to—”
>
>Jude had kept back his own grief on account of her; but he now broke down; and this stimulated Sue to efforts of sympathy which in some degree distracted her from her poignant self-reproach. When everybody was gone, she was allowed to see the children.
>
>The boy’s face expressed the whole tale of their situation. On that little shape had converged all the inauspiciousness and shadow which had darkened the first union of Jude, and all the accidents, mistakes, fears, errors of the last. He was their nodal point, their focus, their expression in a single term. For the rashness of those parents he had groaned, for their ill assortment he had quaked, and for the misfortunes of these he had died.

It is not technical: he describes the features of the last generation; ==children have no hope==; the have been deprived of the faith in the future and in progress, and of the wish to live.

Unlike ==Dickens's children==, who suffer hardship, misery, exploitation but always maintain their wish to live, and to improve their miserable condition thanks to their qualities, Hardy's children have no hope.

==Hardy's children== have no hope, because they have been deprived of an optimistic vision of life.

The lines highlighted in light blue are the ==reasons== for Little Father choice of ==suicide==; they are related to Sue's and Jude's mistakes. Little Father has acted out of despair; he had been told the previous night that Sue was pregnant again.

#### Fourth part: 51-86

**Sue's and Jude's attempts to find an explanation**

>When the house was silent, and they could do nothing but await the coroner’s inquest, a subdued, large, low voice spread into the air of the room from behind the heavy walls at the back.
>
>“What is it?” said Sue, her spasmodic breathing suspended.
>
>“The organ of the college chapel. The organist practising I suppose. It’s the anthem from the seventy-third Psalm; ‘Truly God is loving unto Israel.’”
>
>She sobbed again. “Oh, oh my babies! They had done no harm! Why should they have been taken away, and not I!”
>
>There was another stillness—broken at last by two persons in conversation somewhere without.
>
>“They are talking about us, no doubt!” moaned Sue. “‘We are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men!’”
>
>Jude listened—“No—they are not talking of us,” he said. “They are two clergymen of different views, arguing about the eastward position. Good God—the eastward position, and all creation groaning!”
>
>Then another silence, till she was seized with another uncontrollable fit of grief. “There is something external to us which says, ‘You shan’t!’ First it said, ‘You shan’t learn!’ Then it said, ‘You shan’t labour!’ Now it says, ‘You shan’t love!’”
>
>He tried to soothe her by saying, “That’s bitter of you, darling.”
>
>“But it’s true!”
>
>Thus they waited, and she went back again to her room. The baby’s frock, shoes, and socks, which had been lying on a chair at the time of his death, she would not now have removed, though Jude would fain have got them out of her sight. But whenever he touched them she implored him to let them lie, and burst out almost savagely at the woman of the house when she also attempted to put them away.
>
>Jude dreaded her dull apathetic silences almost more than her paroxysms. “Why don’t you speak to me, Jude?” she cried out, after one of these. “Don’t turn away from me! I can’t bear the loneliness of being out of your looks!”
>
>“There, dear; here I am,” he said, putting his face close to hers.
>
>“Yes… Oh, my comrade, our perfect union—our two-in-oneness—is now stained with blood!”
>
>“Shadowed by death—that’s all.”
>
>“Ah; but it was I who incited him really, though I didn’t know I was doing it! I talked to the child as one should only talk to people of mature age. I said the world was against us, that it was better to be out of life than in it at this price; and he took it literally. And I told him I was going to have another child. It upset him. Oh how bitterly he upbraided me!”
>
>“Why did you do it, Sue?”
>
>“I can’t tell. It was that I wanted to be truthful. I couldn’t bear deceiving him as to the facts of life. And yet I wasn’t truthful, for with a false delicacy I told him too obscurely.—Why was I half-wiser than my fellow-women? And not entirely wiser! Why didn’t I tell him pleasant untruths, instead of half-realities? It was my want of self-control, so that I could neither conceal things nor reveal them!”
>
>“Your plan might have been a good one for the majority of cases; only in our peculiar case it chanced to work badly perhaps. He must have known sooner or later.”

The have two completely different ==reactions==. **Jude** thinks chance has acted against them, and he thinks they can together overcame difficulties; hope is symbolized by the baby that is going to be born: a new family and a new life. **Sue** thinks their union has been shadowed by Death; she thinks their perfect union has been stained with blood and therefore it is ruined.

These different reactions will lead them ==to part==. Sue is characterized by the sense of guilt, which is due to the strict moral code of the victorian society. **Victorian society** considers their relationship obscene, while the **Church** condemns them as sinners and doesn't recognize their sorrow. *Once more religion is unable to help*.

Sentences underlined in blue contain an ironical description of ==God's love== for his people. It is ironical because actually Hardy wants to say that God has completely forgotten Jude and Sue and their needs.

After this novel Hardy's editor asked him not to write anymore novels since they were too pessimistic. He tried his hand to write poems, but they were as pessimistic and as dramatic as his novels

# Modern Age

## The Edwardian Age

The **Edwardian Age** begins in the 1901, after the end of the Victorian Age. After Queen Victorian reign her son Edward became king as **king Edward VII**. He will reign till 1910.
1901 is an important year, since it represents the border between the two ages.
Talking about the Edwardian age we refer to a period which extends to the begins of the WWI.

At that time Britain was one of the richest nations of the globe, and the Britain Empire covered at least one fifth of the whole globe. British economy was been challenged by other economies, by France, Germany and the US. Germany had imperial ambitions too, which finally lead to one of the great crisis in history.

King Edward VII was a fine diplomat. In this situation in 1904 he signed an agreement with France, called **Entente Cordiale**: Britain could pursuit its interests in Egypt while France could pursuit its interests in Morocco.
This agreement will be included in the **Triple Entente** [Triplice alleanza], which was an agreement between Britain, France and Russia. It was made to counterbalance the **Triple Alliance**, between Germany, Austria and Italy.

### Society

The society during this period was really similar to the one of previous age, whit class distinctions, a widespread poverty.

In 1906 there were the political election in Britain, won by the liberals; they made significant reforms: at the time the liberals were internally divided into two groups:
* Liberals who supported the traditional liberal values
* An other group, called *new liberalism* was in favour of certain form of State intervention in social life

Among the new liberals there was David Lloyd Georg, which was the Chancellor of the Exchequer [erario]: he was in charge of the Country’s finances. This group managed to make some reforms, such as the **foundation of the welfare state**.

In 1910 King Edward VII died, and his son George V became king.

The first decade of the 20th century was a period of political, social and cultural debate.
In 1909 minimum wages were fixed; in 1911 workers were given benefits such as free medical treatment and sickness.

### Suffragettes

**Suffragettes** are part of a movement who fought for the rights of women, such as the right to vote (as men could do). In Great Britain the leader was Emmeline Pankhurst, who found a movement called *Women’s Social and Political Union*. At the begin they fought peacefully, but this never lead to anything. They started to fight in a more violent way to reach their aim: they chained themselves at fences, they broke windows, they spat at the policemen. A lot of them were sent to prison, where they felt as political prisoners, and so many of them went on hunger strikes as a form of protest.
Eventually, in 1918 rich women over 30 obtain the right to vote, but they had to wait until 1928 for the universal suffrage.

## World War One

The event that triggered the outbreak of WWI was the **murder** of the archduke **Franz Ferdinand** in Sarajevo by a serbian nationalist.

After this, Austria started bombarding Belgrade.

Then Germany invaded Belgium, as an alternative way to invade France, and declared war to France and Russia.

So the UK declared war, since Germany was challenging Britain at the control of sea. The UK understood that this war was not going to be short; it understood that in order to win it, it needed soldiers and a stronger army. Volunteers were accepted but it was difficult to turn volunteers into soldiers, so it was introduced the **conscription** (leva militare) and when they did that a lot of women replaced men on job, and they proved to be as good as men. So this event helped to reach the universal suffrage.

#### Britain at war

By September 1914 the German army had reached the River Marne in France, where a great battle stopped the German advance at the cost of many lives. When the British Secretary of State for War, Lord Kitchener, realised that the war was going to last a long time and that Britain would have to send a large army overseas, he appealed for volunteers, but it would take time to turn them into soldiers. Britain relied on these volunteers until 1916. The Empire made its contribution sending troops from the dominions as well as volunteers from Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Conscription was introduced in Britain in 1916. Women replaced men in their civilian jobs with reliability and competence, which contributed to bringing about women's suffrage.

#### The Easter Rising in Ireland

A major issue of British politics in the first two decades of the 20th century was the Irish Question. The term refers to the tragic events regarding the fight for Irish independence. In April 1916 there was a rebellion in Dublin, the so-called Easter Rising, due to the fact that Home Rule, voted by the Commons in 1914, had been suspended until the end of the war. The leaders of the insurrection received support from Germany and seized the General Post Office and other buildings in the centre of the city. The rebellion was repressed and 15 of the leaders executed. The Irish Republican party Sinn Féin (an Irish name meaning ourselves alone'), which was fighting for the reunification of Ireland, began to grow in popularity exploiting the fear the Irish had that military conscription might extend to Ireland.

#### A war of attrition

In May 1915 a German submarine sank the British passenger liner Lusitania and more than a thousand people died, including 128 Americans. The US President Thomas Woodrow Wilson (1913-21) sent diplomatic protests to Germany. In the same month Italy joined France and Britain, and the German Zeppelin airship carried out the first aerial bombing of London.
The bloodiest battle in British history took place on the Somme, in northern France, in July 1916. The Somme was a perfect example of the war of attrition, where huge battles were fought not to win strategic objectives or seize resources, but to kill soldiers and wear down the enemy. Soldiers retreated into trenches behind barbed wire; machine guns, poison gas, tanks and aircraft were used. The Germans also relied on submarines, called U-boats, to fight the war at sea. These submarines were effective in sinking warships and the merchant ships carrying important supplies from the USA. Life in the trenches was very stressful because of mud, lack of hygiene, boredom and fear of gas. So the soldiers relieved the stress means of superstition, religion, poetry, letters and drink. 'Shell shock was the term used by doctors to allude to the psychological effect of shell explosions, blamed for the frequent cases of psychological disorders among soldiers. The horror of trench life was recalled by the War Poets. Domestic and international stress reached its climax in the late 1917 and early 1918: in July 1917 George V changed the name of the British royal family from the German Saxe-Coburg-Gotha into the British Windsor; the Bolsheviks seized power in Russia and the Italian army collapsed at the Battle of Caporetto in October 1917. The Austrians had mass surrenders and desertions, Germany was starving. The United States joined the war in April 1917 on Britain's side.

#### The end of the war

In September 1918 British artillery began dropping shells on the Hindenburg Line, a series of German trenches believed to be impenetrable, while tanks and infantry attacked on the ground. By October the Germans were retreating along the Western Front. Warfare cost the Allies and the Germans about 260,000 casualties respectively. On 4th October 1918 Germany asked President Woodrow Wilson for an armistice which would bring about German withdrawal from occupied territory and allow national self-determination, but included no punishment for the country Britain and France agreed for fear that American power might increase if war continued. On 11th November, at 11 o'clock, the guns fell silent and the day has forever been commemorated as Armistice Day. It was also called 'Remembrance Day' or Poppy Day as, once the war was over, the poppy was one of the only plants to grow on the battlefields. The peace treaty was signed at Versailles in 1919 by the Allied powers. It stipulated the Allied occupation of the Rhineland, unilateral disarmament and heavy financial reparation of 'war guilt for Germany. President Woodrow Wilson proposed 'Fourteen Points' to work out the peace treaty and prevent future wars. He presented a plan to set up the League of Nations. This was to be an international organisation, with its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, and was to act as a forum for resolving international disputes. However, it proved very difficult to create, and Wilson left office without managing to convince the USA to join. The League of Nations was the forerunner of the United Nations.

## Inter-war years

#### Towards independence

The effort the dominions of the British Empire had made during the war created expectations of reward. In 1926 an imperial conference created a new entity from the dominions of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa with the name of 'Commonwealth. In 1931 the Statute of Westminster formally granted the sovereign right of each dominion to control its own domestic and foreign affairs and to establish its own diplomatic corps. India suffered regional and religious tensions accompanied by rising support for the Nationalist Congress Party. Steps towards self-government were being taken, under the pressure from Mohandas Gandhi's (1869-1948) non-cooperation movement, whose popular campaigns undermined the deference to British authority on which imperial rule depended. The Government of India Act in 1935 established self-government at a provincial level in the hope of maintaining Britain's control of the country as a whole.

#### The Irish War of Independence

In the 1918 election in Ireland, the Sinn Féin party won almost all the seats except in the province of Ulster, but instead of going to Westminster, it set up an independent Parliament in Dublin - the Dáil - in 1919. The Irish Volunteers, a militant nationalist organisation founded in 1913, became the IRA (Irish Republican Army) and they declared open war on Britain in 1920, under the leadership of Michael Collins (1890 - 1922). The IRA terrorist attacks were brutally met by Black and Tan' police auxiliaries, culminating with 'Bloody Sunday' in 1920, when the 'Black and Tans' shot 12 dead at a football match in Dublin.
In 1921 an Anglo-Irish treaty established the Irish Free State, under the leadership of Eamon de Valera (1882-1975), as an independent State within the British Commonwealth. Only six counties centered on Protestant Ulster remained a self-governing province of the United Kingdom. In 1922 a civil war broke out in Ireland between those who accepted the Anglo-Irish Treaty and those who were against it. In 1923 the anti-Treaty faction, who wanted the inclusion of the six counties of Ulster in the Republican Ireland, was defeated.

#### The aftermath of WWI

The aftermath of World War I was marked by a world economic boom. A house-building programme started in Britain and there were improvements in public health; 40% of the population was covered by medical insurance. There was a boom in the sales of the daily press, Newspapers, which had been almost the only means of mass communication before the First World War, were supplemented in the 1920s by the development of radio broadcasting. In 1927 the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) was created.

However, the Wall Street Crash of 1929 dramatically affected life between the wars, since in the following year banks went bankrupt across Europe. The war had damaged Britain's position as the biggest exporter of manufactured goods because production had been turned to the war effort. Therefore, British customers had found new suppliers in South America and Asia. Working hours were cut, prices fell but the attempt to cut wages was resisted by the trade unions. There were miners' strikes and a General Strike was called in 1926. The most urgent inter-war issue was unemployment and the gap between North and South took on a new dimension: the once powerful industrial North became depressed and challenged by new growing automobile, chemical and electrical goods industries in the South and the Midlands, Restoring demand to the iron and steel industries began with rearmament in 1936.

#### The difficult 1930s

From 1935, Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin (1923-37) led a Conservative government which was opposed to another war. He had to make controversial decisions regarding the abdication crisis of 1936 and rearmament. The popular young king, Edward VIII, who had succeeded his father George V, wanted to marry a twice divorced American woman. Baldwin forced his abdication on the grounds that he could not marry her and keep the throne. The king's brother succeeded as George VI (1936-52). As for rearmament, the need for a strong Royal Air Force (RAF) independent of the army and the navy led the British government to shift spending onto the RAF. At the same time a ship-building programme was funded aimed at a 'two-ocean fleet'.

#### Towards World War II

In 1935 the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini (1883-1945) attacked the African monarchy of Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and took the first steps towards an alliance with Germany, where Adolf Hitler (1889-1945) and his Nazi Party had come to power in 1933. Hitler sent troops illegally into the Rhineland in 1936. In the same year a three-year long civil war started in Spain between Nationalists and Republicans. A crisis also began in the East with a Japanese attack on China in 1937.
Hitler invaded Austria in 1938 proclaiming its union with Germany and breaking the Treaty of Versailles. In November 1938 Kristallnacht, organised violence against Jewish people and property in Germany took place, followed by the occupation of Prague in March 1939. In August Hitler signed the secret Molotov Ribbentrop non-aggression pact with Stalin (1879-1953) and on 1st September he invaded Poland. Two days later Britain and France declared war on Germany.

## The Second World War

#### The beginning of the war

When war began in 1939, in Britain evacuation schemes were organised to move people, especially children, from the towns and cities; hospital patients were sent home to release beds; the paintings of the National Gallery were stored in mines in North Wales and underground stations soon became shelters for civilians during night-time raids. The United Kingdom sent British troops to aid in the defence of France.

In April 1940 Hitler invaded Norway and Denmark by sea and air, because about a third of Germany's iron ore supply came from Scandinavia. In May there was a sudden German attack on Holland and Belgium, while German tank corps were heading for Paris. British Prime Minister Chamberlain (1937-40) resigned in 1940 and Sir Winston Churchill took over (1940-45). The British ordered the retreat of their troops to Dunkirk, where they had to be lifted from the beaches by Royal Navy ships and private boats whose owners volunteered to bring back our boys Meanwhile Japan overran Hong Kong and Burma (now Myanmar) and began to threaten Singapore and India. America kept aloof despite Churchill's constant appeals for help.

#### Operation Sea Lion

Hitler was planning the invasion of Britain, Operation Sea Lion. The Luftwaffe, the German air force, had to put Britain's defence in the Southeast out of action, in order to open the way for the sea invasion. In 1940 the Battle of Britain saw English and German bombers fighting in the skies over Sussex and Kent. The battle was won by Britain, but Hitler changed his strategy and ordered the 'Blitz, an intense bombing of civilian targets in London and other cities, with the aim of weakening the enemy. King George VI and his wife Elizabeth refused to leave London and remained in Buckingham Palace, becoming symbols of resistance. In spite of the devastation and the deaths of thousands of civilians, the British people did not fall into submission.

#### Operation Barbarossa

In 1941 German forces advanced south and east, and in Africa General Rommel forced the British army to retreat. In June Hitler decided to declare war on the Soviet Union because he wanted to get the oilfields in the Caucasus region. The so-called 'Operation Barbarossa was the largest military operation in history and would consume Germany's resources for the rest of the war.

#### America joined the war

In December 1941 Japan bombed the US fleet in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. President Franklin D. Roosevelt (1932-45) declared war on Japan, and Germany declared war on America. The Japanese quickly advanced in the Far East. In 1942, with the Battle of Midway Island, the US fleet sank four Japanese aircraft carriers, weakening the Japanese position in the Pacific. In November 1942 General Montgomery defeated Rommel at El-Alamein, thus preventing the fall of Egypt. In July 1943 the Allies landed in Sicily led by General George Patton, and a long fight up Italian territory began. Germany's advance eastward was stopped by their defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad, where the Soviet forces surrounded and crushed an entire German army. This was a turning point in the war. The Allies continued to score victories against the Germans, also helped by the science of sonar, radar and the Enigma code-breaking computer. In the summer of 1944 the Allies entered Rome and decided to open a western front in France.

#### Operation Overlord

The greatest amphibious force in history arrived on the beaches of Normandy on 6th June 1944, also known as D-Day. The Germans retreated across France and counter-attacked at the Battle of the Bulge in the Belgian Ardennes in December 1944. General Patton's forces played a key role in defeating the German counter-attack, after which they went across the Rhine River and into Germany.

#### The end of the war

The Soviet Red Army was slowly advancing, liberating Poland, Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Austria and the eastern fringes of Germany. On 30th April 1945 Hitler committed suicide, and Berlin fell on 2nd May. At the Yalta Conference in Crimea in February 1945, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill and Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin made important decisions concerning the future progress of the war and the post-war world. The war ended in Europe on 8th May 1945 but it took another three months to defeat Japan in the Far East. Victory came only with the explosion of two atomic bombs on the Japanese towns of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6th and 9th August. The atomic bombing ended World War II and began a new age.

## USA
### Progressivism

It’s a new policy adopted by US by Theodore Roosevelt, based on a series of reforms on the social and economic spheres.

The position of the US during WWI was at the beginning of not intervening; they only took part in 1917: this allowed to US to gain economic superiority, since the costs of the war were different from the others countries.
In Fact in the end of the Great War US was one of the richest country of the world: this period will be called the Roaring Twenties, whose main characteristics are:
* There was an economic boom
* Red Scare: was the fear of socialism spread through US; a lot of political activist were seen as Communists sympathiser, and they were killed.
* Prohibition: It’s referred to a ban of the government, about production, importation and distribution of alcohol; there was a problem of alcohol addiction among the poor. This led to an illegal market of alcohol.
* Feeling of xenofobia spread among the people; previously the us followed an open door policy, but now we have a different approach with a series of restrictions on immigration, with the segregation of minority.

The economic boom of the twenties led to an excessive speculation, which led to the Wall Street crash of the 1929: it produced an strong economic crisis all around the world.

There was also an environmental disaster, the so called Dust Bowl, which is used to refer to a series of dust stores that took place in soma place in the us, following a period of drought.

After this period of crisis there was the period of the **New Deal**: it’s a series of reforms by Franklin Roosevelt: based on **Relief**, **Recovey** and **Reform**

1. Relief is related to the poor
2. Recovery of the economy
3. Reform of the financial system in order to prevent future crisis

### After WWI

Also in the US WWI marked an epochal change; in particular it represented a sharp break both with the past and with those european influences and conventions that have dominated the american cultural scene. American writers and artists wanted to deal with modernism in their own way, without following those european influences that had been so dominant since colonial times.

After the great war in the US we have **great experimentation**; during the Roaring Twenties, with its economic growth and prosperity, there was the **Jazz age**; Jazz music and dance style gained popularity in the us. America fell in love with Jazz music and dancing style, and also with the new forms of entertainment, such as Cinema and Radio.

This was a period of contradictions, because the '20s are also associated to the Prohibition era, which was based on the ban on the production and sale of Alcohol. In spites of this ban and laws, Night clubs proliferated during the twenties, american enjoyed joining parties and drinking cocktail, and some writers describe the glamour of life of jazz age also bringing to light the absence of values that was hidden behind this glamour.

In the first half of the 20th century, in the US, we have the flourishing of the Afro-american Culture. This is often referred to with the expression **Harlem Renaissance**: Harlem was a neighborhood in New York city where the black community of afroamerican was located.

During the 20s the black community of afroamericans sparkled with entusiasm and they are importan because they contributed to redefine the concept of the **Nigro**. The Harlem Renaissance is also called **the new Nigro Movement**. It isn't just a literary movement, but also a cultural movement, an intellectual movement, that began in Harlem after the Great War.

The main features of the new Nigro Movement is this attempt to redefine the nigro apart from the white stereotipes that had influenced black people until then. The new Nigro Movement raised important issues in realtion to the concept of marginalization, of alienation and also of self definition.

### WWII

American factories received a new impulse from the Second World War. At first the United States maintained neutrality, following its policy of **isolationism**, but it joined the conflict in 1941. All resources were organised towards winning the war, including two thousand million dollars spent on the Manhattan Project, a research project to produce and test the first atomic bomb. Among the scientists working in the nuclear field was the Italian physicist Enrico Fermi (1901-54). The main assembly plant was built at Los Alamos, New Mexico.

After the WWII the USA emerged as one of the superpowers together with Russia.

# Age of Anxiety & Modernism

## The crisis of certainties

The First World War left Britain in a disillusioned and cynical mood: some soldiers celebrated their return home with a frantic search for pleasure; others were haunted by a sense of guilt for the horrors of trench warfare, or missed the sense of purpose the war years had given them. The gap between the generation of the young and the older one, regarded as responsible for the terrible waste of lives during the war, grew wider and wider. An increasing feeling of rootlessness and frustration, due to the slow dissolution of the Empire into the Commonwealth, led to a transformation of the notions of imperial hegemony and white superiority.
Writers like Edward Morgan Forster became averse to political subjection and thought in terms of personal relationships based on equality and feeling. The committed writers of the 1930s and 1940s like Wystan Hugh Auden and George Orwell warned their readers against totalitarianism.
Nothing seemed to be right or certain: scientists and philosophers destroyed the old, predictable universe which had sustained the Victorians in their optimistic outlook, and new views of man and the universe that had emerged at the beginning of the century spread through society.

## Influences of Modernism

* Technological innovation in 20th century:
  * introduction of electricity, which had a huge impact on life
  * improvement in mass transport
  * advent of the Radio, Cinema: thank to the radio people could reach informations more easily, and this produce a feeling of cohesion
  * the governments were aware of the power of this mass communication mean: it was an easier and wider propaganda

### Freud

He is an Austrian psychologist, founder of the psychoanalysis. He published the _Interpretation of dreams_ in 1900: in this essay he analyses the unconscious. There are 2 components in our mind, and the unconscious is the most important one. There is something inside us that pushes us to do or not to do something: this hidden force operate somehow in an unconscious way. His theory was quite disturbing at that time because he stated that we are in some way non controlled. The discovery that man's actions could be motivated by irrational forces of which he might know nothing is very disturbing.

Human mind is formed by the **ID**, the **EGO** and the **SUPEREGO**.
1. The **id** is the most instinctual part and the most primitive; it's where we have our impulses, such as sex instinct, eros, aggressivity; it doesn't change with time, and it is not related to the external world.
2. The **ego** is the part of our mind related to rationality.
3. The **superego** is subdivided in 2 components: the **moral conscience**, which has the role to feel us guilty; the role of the **ideaself** is to show us how we should behave.

The ego has a mediation role between the impulses and our morality. According to him the unconscious is the post important part and dreams are the only way to enter the unconscious. Dreams are the key to access and to analyze our mind, and in particular the unconscious component of our mind.

He used a method called **free association of ideas** in order to investigate our mind, and this concept strongly influenced the modern age.

His theory also placed enormous importance on the demands of the 'libido', particularly those manifested in Oedipus phase.
The Freudian concept of infantile sexuality focused attention on the importance of early development, and childhood regained a status it had only in the pages of Rousseau.

For Modernism, Interpretation of dreams to understand our behaviour

##### The theory of the unconscious

Freud is undoubtedly best known for his studies about the unconscious mind and its fundamental role in the understanding of conscious thought and behaviour. For Freud, dreams were an insight into our innermost thoughts and he called them the 'royal road to the unconscious because they were a means of revealing the workings of the unconscious mind. He developed his first theory of the psyche in _The Interpretation of Dreams_ (1900), in which he stated that the unconscious is where dreams and all the automatic thoughts that arise spontaneously without a recognisable cause are formed. The unconscious is where the forgotten memories lie in a dormant state and they may become accessible to the conscious mind at a later time. It is also the container of implicit knowledge that has been passed down from generation to generation.

##### Id, ego and superego

Freud believed that our personality develops through interaction between the three main parts of the human mind: the id, ego and superego

The id is the most primitive. Within the id are all the inherited components of personality we are born with, including the sex instinct, the Eros and the instinct towards aggression. The id operates entirely unconsciously; it does not change with time or experience, since it is not related to the external world.

The ego is the rational, pragmatic part of our personality. It is less primitive than the id and is both conscious and unconscious; it represents what may be called reason and common sense. Freud used the word ego' to mean a set of psychic functions such as judgement, tolerance, reality testing, control, planning, defence, synthesis of information, intellectual functioning and memory

The superego is concerned with social rules and morals, and covers what many would refer to as conscience. It develops around the age of 3-5 and it consists of two systems, the conscience and the ideal self. The conscience is a part that can punish the ego by making it feel guilty. The ideal self, on the other hand, creates an imaginary picture of how you ought to be, and deals with ambition and social behaviour, including how to treat others and how to be a useful member of society.

According to Freud, the id, ego and superego are in constant conflict so that adult personality and behaviour are derived directly from the results of these internal childhood struggles.

##### The Oedipus complex

Freud believed that a common source of psychic conflict derived from sexual fantasies in childhood and this theory seemed obscene to the respectable public at that time. The most famous example of conflict is the Oedipus complex, which is probably the most controversial of all his theories of relationships. In 1909 Freud wrote a paper, _Analysis of a Phobia in a Five-Year-Old Boy_, in which he outlined the fear of horses of a boy known as 'Little Hans'. Freud believed that the boy's terror was due to feelings of anger related to his parents he had internalised. According to Freud, all small boys choose their mother as their primary object of desire. They subconsciously wish to usurp their father and become their mother's lover. These desires appear between the ages of 3 and 5. when a boy is in what Freud defined as the phallic stage of development. This stage represents an important point in the formation of sexual identity. The analogous experience for girls is known as the Electra complex, in which girls feel desire for their father and jealousy of their mother. The child, however, suspects that acting on these feelings would lead to danger, thus he/she represses his/her desires. This leads to anxiety. In order to resolve the conflict. the boy then identifies with his father and the girl with her mother. It is at this point that the superego is formed; it becomes an internalisation of the parental figure that strives to suppress the id's impulses and make the ego act upon these idealistic standards.

##### Adler and Jung

Although Freud's second masterpiece _Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality_ (1905) further alienated him from contemporary psychiatry, he soon found loyal disciples. They founded the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society in 1908. However, some of them moved away from their master; the two best known were Alfred Adler (1870-1937) and Carl Gustav Jung 6.3]. Adler highlighted the importance of the aggression with which those people who lack some quality they desire express their discontent. Inferiority complex, a much abused term, is Adlerian.


### Jung

An other important figure was Carl Gustav Jung. He was a swiss philosopher and psychologist. He developed the theory of the **collective unconscious**. It is a set of belief that we inherit from the past, and it is such a cultural memory, containing the universal images and beliefs of the human race. This meant that some figures or objects of the everyday world had great symbolic power, and people responded to them unconsciously.

The role of the artist was to bring these archetypes to the surface.

### Albert Einstein

The growing crisis of confidence was also due to the introduction of 'relativity' in science. Albert Einstein's theory of relativity discarded the concepts of time and space: even time and space are subjective. The world view lost its solidity and the scientific revolution was complemented by verbal experimentation and the exploration of memory in literature.

### Henry Bergson

He was a french philosopher who said that time can be divided into **historical time** and **psychological time**.
1. **Historical time** is the eternal time, which is objective and can be measured by a clock.
2. **Psychological time** is internal and subjective: we can measure it by emotions and feelings.

He introduced the concept of **duration**, to highlight the subjective dimension of time, because it is made by past, present and future that overload each other.

### Anthropological studies

In the social sphere, increasing knowledge tended to shake faith in the assumed rightness of Western ways of behaviour. Sir James George Frazer's (1854-1941) _The Golden Bough_ (1890) and other studies of anthropology helped undermine the absolute truth of religious and ethical systems in favour of more relativist standpoints. Primitive societies began to be regarded as integrated structures and, as a result, a large variety of forms of social organisation was analysed and made known.

### A new picture of man

The problem that lay behind all these manifestations of uncertainty was the inability to arrive at a commonly accepted picture of man. To Freud man was a part of nature, a biological and psychological phenomenon; to Marx he was the outcome of social and economic forces.

### Nietzsche

He introduce the concept related to the objectivity of truth.
He questioned the objectivity of truth. There is no more an universal truth

In _Thus spoke Zarathrusta_ he said that 'God is dead'. He uses this expression to refer to the end of the beliefs of a cosmic figure that orders everything. Under the influence of the ideas of the German philosopher Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (1844-1900), who had declared that 'God is dead' and had substituted Christian morality with a belief in human power and perfectibility, the Christian notion of man as owing his possibilities of salvation to God's grace lost its former strength. Though Christianity underwent revivals of interest, religious controversy no longer vitally affected public issues. More and more people became aware that there were alternatives to Christianity and some intellectuals turned to esoteric beliefs.


### William James

He was an american philosopher and he discussed the notion of the **stream of consciousness**. This is a psychic phenomenon referred to the flowing of thoughts, emotions, memories and feelings, that occurs in human mind.

## Modernism

It refers to an international movement that involved different types of artistic expression: it wasn't only a literary movement because it also involved **music**, **cinema** and the **visual arts**.

It is a transversal movemente, since it covers a wide variety of attitude:
* escalation in artistic innovation
* the epicentre is considered to be Paris
* modernism drew inspiration from everywhere: past, foreign literatures or artistic expressions.

### Features

#### Literary Movement
As a **literary movement** it is tipically associated with the period after WWI. There is a **fragmentation** of the values of the past, since the present is confused.

In this context there is an element which is common to all the modernists, that is the desire to break with tradition, and express new ways of expression; in order to break with the past, they rejected the typical narrative techniques of the past.
They found a solution in the inner world: they wanted to emphasize the subjective dimension. **Subjectivism** is an other key concept

#### Artistic movement
As an **artistic movement** features are
* **distortion of shapes**, particularly visibile in arts with cubism (Picasso and George Braque), which introduced this new way of representing the world
* they didn't want to reproduce reality as it was, but they try to rebuilt reality with a serie of geometrical shapes, such as cones, cilinder, spheres, reassembling them offering a new vision of the world, to highlight that there is not just a single reality, that there is **no objective truth**.

#### Music movement
As a **music movement**, we have Stravinsky. He was famous because he put into dialogue different styles from different epoques, and in so doing he produces a dissonant result.

### Modern Poetry

At the turn of the century poetry was characterised by an high degree of fragmentation: poetry developed in different paths and different branches; some were more traditional, and other were more experimental.

#### Georgian Poets
Talking about the more traditional branch of modern poetry there is the **georgian poets**. This name come from the tile of an anthology which was published during the reign of George V.

This name was associated to tradition, to convention, since the Georgian poet were still close to the tradition of the previous centuries. They did not experiment with poetry; on the contrary they were mostly hostile against any form of innovation.

#### War poets
The **war poets** focused on war; they dealt with this concepts in very different ways: we can identify two different branches:
* Some poets exalted the glories of war; they were moved by a feeling of patriotism and they exalted the glories of war, and probably the most representative poet is *Rupert Brooke*. This is a traditional branch
* An other group, on the contrary, was against this false propaganda by the political authorities of the time who pushed young man to join the army and fight and die for the country, and for which the war was a good thing. They wanted to end this because they showed the horrors of war, the terrible conditions in which soldiers lives in the trench; many of them took part in WWI. This is an innovative branch. They paved the way for modernists poetry. The main representative was Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sasson.

#### Imagism
Imagism is an other branch of modern poetry, whose main poet was Ezra Pound. Imagist focused on a single image and scene, and they were characterised by a sense of complete freedom in the choice of subject matter.

The main features are:
* They focused on a single image, object, scene
* They felt completely free in the choice of subject matter
* They made use of a clear, precise and concise language
* Their poems were usually very short
* Their aim was to reach the truth of objects, precision
* They rejected the conventions of the past, and for instance they adopted free verse: they didn’t follow a metrical regularity: some of these features were to became characteristic of the whole Modernism

#### Symbolism
The main representative was the American poet T.S. Eliot and the Irish poet W.B. Yeats.

It was a loosely [vagamente organizzato] organized literally and artistic movements which originated with a group of french poet around the end of the 19 century. The main representative french symbolist was Baudelaire

The main features are
* The main focus was symbol: the symbolists preferred to evoke rather than to state and for this reason they made use of a suggestive and evocative language. They preferred to use indirect statements instead of directs
* Their poetry might seem hermetic, because each poet somehow invented his own symbolic system
* They wanted the reader to attribute their own meanings to the poems: they had to personally interprets the poems

#### Oxford Poets

In the ‘30s an other group of poets came on prominence.
Their name came from the fact that each of them studies at Oxford.

They were politically active on the left, and their main themes were social, justice, sense of community: they were socially and politically committed.

Their main focus was that of communicating with their fellow men, and in fact their style was simpler in comparison to the style used by the symbolists. They were afraid of the tyranny of fascists.

They wanted in their poems to point out a sort of moral cours of actions: they wanted to highlight a moral course of actions that completely contrasted those tyranysts.

Their main representative was the British Auden

#### New Romantics

In the ‘40s there was an other group of poets. Their name came for the fact that they rejected the intellectualism of the symbolists and the social and political commitment of the oxford poets.

 Their focus was about emotions. The main themes were
* Love
* Birth
* Death
* Sex

That’s why they were labelled **New romantics**.

### Modern Novel
WWI signed an epochal break with the past. The novel was essentially *bourgeois* in its origin: this means that when the novel emerges as a new literary genre it was meant as a mirror of society.

In the 18 century there was the rise of the novel, and the main focus was representing society; novel as a mirror of society. The main theme was **social mobility**, either upwards and downwards

Usually the novels had a linear structure, with a chronological sequence of events and their plots were well structured.

With the Great War, which shuttered people consciences, the modernists could no more represent society, since it was difficult: all the pillars on which society were based on totally collapsed.

In this contest of unrest and turmoil they were somehow forced by the circumstances to focus on their inner world instead of the outer world; they emphasize subjectivity; in this regard they were deeply influenced by Freud’s theories about the unconscious; they were very interested in the existence of different levels of consciousness and unconsciousness.
They were interested in how past experiences influences the adult behavior.

In order to deal with subjectivity they rejected the narrative techniques of the past: they were casually forced to do that, since it was impossible to represent the mind using the narrative techniques of the previous century.

The technique used in this period, to represent the constant flow of thoughts feeling and emotions, was the interior monologue. The interior monologue was the stylistic translation of the psychic phenomenon called *stream of consciousness*.

This phenomenon is based on the idea that thoughts bounds from past to present and future in the same time in our mind. There is a mixture of different temporal dimensions.

As a consequence the modernists rejected linear plots in their novels, and the events are not narrated according to a chronological order; they didn’t adopt a linear sequence of events in their novels. Since they focus on subjectivity and on the workings of the mind, in order to represent this unspoken activity of the mind, they were forced to mix past present and future: they couldn’t follow a chronological order in their novels; the easiest way years to translate this psychic phenomenon in their novels was the adoption of the *interior monologue*.

There are different types of interior monologue

* **indirect** interior monologue: we still have the guiding presence of a narrator; in the past the narrator played a key role in the development of the novel; here instead rejected the use of a third person omniscient narrator; even when we talk about the indirect interior monologue, and we actually have a narrator, this is a neutral presence, who filters the thoughts of the characters, with some introductive comments and explanations
* **direct** interior monologue: the character’s thoughts are given directly to the reader, without any filter.

# Aestheticism

* ==p. 29-30==

## The birth of the Aesthetic Movement {ignore=true}

The Aesthetic Movement developed in the universities and intellectual circles in the last decades of the 19th century. It began in France with Théophile Gautier (1811-72) and reflected the sense of frustration and uncertainty of the artist, his reaction against the materialism and the restrictive moral code of the bourgeoisie, and his need to redefine the role of art. As a result, French artists withdrew from the political and social scene and escaped into aesthetic isolation, into what Gautier defined 'Art for art's sake'. The bohémien embodies his protest against the monotony and vulgarity of bourgeois life, leading an unconventional existence, pursuing sensation and excess, and cultivating art and beauty.

Aestheticism was a late 19th century European movement, which centered on the doctrine that art exist for the sake of its own beauty. Aestethicism was based on the doctrine according to which art is not supposed to have any sort of social, moral, political, didactic purpose.

It rejected the Victorian idea for which art and literature could have an important ethical role.
Many Victorians believed that they could provide a correct model of behavior which people could identify with.

Literature according to many Victorian could provide example of good action that were rewarded and for this reason literature was seen as a mean of self improvement.

The supporters of the aesthetic movement totally disagreed, arguing that art has nothing to do with morality, So, the aesthetic movement was against those Victorian utilitarian and also materialistic philosophies and it embraced beauty as the chief pursue of both art and life.

Aestheticism began in France with **Gaudier**: he was the first to Adopt the Slogan _L'art pour l'art_, meaning that art has no hidden messages but beauty.

This doctrine was imported into England by James McNeill Whistler (1834-1903), an American painter who worked in England.
However, the roots of the English Aesthetic Movement can be traced back to the Romantic poet John Keats, as well as to Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Rossetti was a remarkable example of an artist dedicated wholly to his art. John Ruskin too, in his search for beauty in life and art, even while insisting upon moral values, paved the way for the works of Walter Pater (1839-94), who is regarded as the main theorist of the Aesthetic Movement in England.

According to some critics however, in Britain the seed of the Aesthetic movement can be traced back to the romantic poet **John Keats**, and the pre-Raphaelite **Dante Gabriel Rossetti**.
- **John Keats** was a romantic poet of the second generation. He was interested in the sensual qualities of poetry and in its capacity to create an autonomous world. In this, sense conceiving art as a separate reality, his verse somehow anticipated the art fo art's sake tendency of the 19th century.
- **Dante Gabriel Rossetti** was a poet and a painter. He belongs to the pre-Raphaelite brotherhood, actually he found it in 1848. The artists of this brotherhood reacted against the dull and unimaginative artistic production of the period by returning to the aesthetic value of the italian painters of the 13th anr the 14th century, who lived before Raffaello.

There are two main important figures who belong to the English Aesthetic movement:
- **John Ruskin** was a leading art critic of the 2nd half of the 19th century; he was highly influential because in his search of beauty in art and life he paved the way fo the work of Walter Peter
- **Walter Peter** is considered the main theorist of the Aesthetic movement. He found in art the only certainty and for this reason he believed that life should be lived as a work of art. He insisted on the concept of **artistic autonomy**; he felt that art should be independent from worldly issues such as politics or morality, because art should be appreciated for its own intrinsic beauty

Walter Pater's _Studies in the History of the Renaissance_ (1873) and his masterpiece _Marius the Epicurean_ (1885) were immediately successful, especially with the young, because of their subversive and potentially demoralising message. He rejected religious faith and said that art was the only means to halt the passage of time, the only certainty. He thought life should be lived in the spirit of art, namely as a work of art, filling each passing moment with intense experience, feeling all kinds of sensations. The task of the artist was to feel sensations, to be attentive to the attractive, the courteous and the cheerful. So the artist was seen as the transcriber 'not of the world, not of mere fact, but of his sense of it! The main implication of this new aesthetic position was that art had no reference to life, and therefore it had nothing to do with morality and did not need to be didactic.

Pater's works had a deep influence on the poets and writers of the 1890s, especially Oscar Wilde, as well as the group of artists that met in the Rhymers' Club and contributed to _The Yellow Book_. This periodical, published from 1894 to 1897, reflected decadent' taste in its sensational subjects. The term decadent' generally implied a process of decline of recognised values. By the end of the century it was used as an aesthetic term across Europe.

## Main Features

A number of features can be distinguished in the works of Aesthetic artists:
* excessive attention to the self;
* hedonistic and sensuous attitude;
* perversity in subject matter;
* disenchantment with contemporary society;
* evocative use of language.

Stylistically the works of the aesthetic writers were highly refined, and they appealed to the senses; they showed an intense connotation of sensuality and hedonism, which is the philosophy according to which pleasure is the main aim in human life.

Their work showed a fierce individualism, in opposition to anything mainstream.

Their work also showed a franc disenchantment with contemporary society; the supporters of the aesthetic movement in literature wanted to shock the middle classes with their art, often creating sexually suggestive pieces of work, that opposed to the Victorian sense of Morality.

Considering the subject matter, they felt free to break the boundaries; they were interested in the exploration of sexuality and of course one of the main themes is the insistence on the close relationship between art and life.

This artist commitment to their theories and belief was so strong that eventually Aestheticism pretended the boundaries of art to became a life style. This mean that component of aesthetic ideology can be seen in the way of living itself.

Supporters of the aesthetic movement lived their life in their approach to fashion, sexuality, but also in the approach to Alcohol and drugs. They were generally seen as heavy alcohol consumers and they were fascinated with the use of drugs.

Considering this close relationship whit art and life there is another key concept that is **dandyism**. A Dandy is a person who pays particular attention to his personal appearance. Usually a Dandy wear eccentric and very elegant clothes, and he is a person who aim at upholding a high level of sophistication in his lifestyle.

## Decadence

The term **Decadence** is often associated with aestheticism.

Decadence must be seen as a European movement. In the late 1880s a group of French writers contributed to the journal _Le Décadent_; they were the Symbolists Rimbaud, Verlaine, Mallarmé, Laforgue, who were much influenced by Charles Baudelaire's _Les Fleurs du mal_ (1857). Joris-Karl Huysmans (1848-1907) wrote _A rebours_ (1884), a novel whose hero, Des Esseintes, tries to create an entirely artificial life in his search for unusual sensations. This character became the model for Wilde's dandy. The main representatives of Decadence in Italy were Gabriele D'Annunzio (1863-1938), with his novel _Il piacere_ (1889), and the poets Giovanni Pascoli (1855-1912) and Guido Gozzano (1883-1916). The poetry of Rainer Maria Rilke (1875-1926) was one of the most remarkable expressions of the Decadent sensibility in the German language.

This word was initially to descrive some French writers of the mid 19th century; in particular decadence is associated to the poetry of
- Verlaine
- MallarmÃ©
- Rimbaud
- Baudelaire
- Huysmans

The term decadence is also associated to the novel "Ã€ Rebours" by Huysmans. The protagonist is Des Esseintes, and he is a decadent aristocrat; he has an obsession with sensual experiments and the novel is based on his taste for luxury and excess.

Aestheticism and decadence share a set of interlinked qualities such as
- the notion of intense refinement
- the perversity in subject matter
- the use of paradoxes
- the progressive attitude towards sexuality.

Decadence was an European movement which did not only developed in France.
In Italy, for instance, the main representatives of the Decadent movement were D'Annunzio (with his novel _Il Piacere_), Pascoli and Gozzano.

# Oscard Wilde
- ==p. 124-125==

He was probably the main representative of the aesthetic movement in Britain.

As it happens with all those writers who are strongly influenced by aesthetic ideologies, his life and his art are closely linked.

## Life

He was ==born in Dublin==, and he was quite well off, because his father was an eye and ear surgeon. His mother was an eccentric woman. She expected Oscar to be a female, so she used to dress him in girl's clothes.

He is educated at Trinity College and here he reveals his ==unconventional personality==, since unlike his fellow students he hates sports and games, he loaths drinking and whoring and he likes fishing and solitude. He was not very popular, both with his teacher, who thought he was lazy, and with his fellow students, because he dislikes their coarse humor and their virile actions.

He reads a lot, and he eventually wins a gold medal for Greek. Thanks to this medal, he wins a scholarship at ==Oxford University==. Here he spends happy years soon establishing a reputation as a brilliant talker, an anti conformist and a wonderful entertainer.

While he was at Oxford he met two intellectual: ==John Ruskin and Walter Pater==. They both influence his life very deeply. **Ruskin** attracted him by his socialist ideals, and **Pater** taught him a new conception of art, devoid of any moral responsibility.

When he finish university he inherited money from his father, and so he settled in ==London==. Here he attracted attention to himself wearing eccentric clothes. He was occasionally seen with a sunflower in his hand, or with exotic flowers in his button hole.

Once in London, he charmed everybody with his brilliant conversation and people enjoyed his company for his witty remarks. He became very popular and in 1882 he was invited to give a lecture tour on aestheticism in America, and when he arrived there, he famously said

> I have nothing to declare but my genius.

His tour was a success, and when he came back he got married and he had two children.

In 1891 he published his first and only novel *The picture of Dorian Gray*; Wilde wasn’t appreciated as a novelist, and his novel was considered immoral, mainly for his insistence on hedonism, but also for his common sexual connotations.

Anyway Wilde managed to increase his literary prestige by turning to the theatre. He reached the climax of his success with his witty comedies. In the years 1892-1895. During those years his comedies were performed at the same time on different stages in London.
His masterpiece in theatre is *The Importance of Being Ernest*, published in 1895.

When he was at the height of his career his reputation rapidly declined, because he was accused of homosexuality by his lover’s father. The accusation proved correct; he was sentenced to two years of hard labour.
He was in prison from 1895 to 1897, and while he was in prison he wrote a poem: *The Ballad of Reading Gaol*, and it was his last published (in 1898) work during his life.

This poem deals with death penalty, because it is about the hanging of a man, for the brutal murder of his wife: Wilde discuss on themes such as injustice, betrayal and the need for forgiveness. The idea he developed is that the greater the crime, the more charity is needed.

While he was in prison he also wrote a long and touching letter to his beloved, entitled *De Profundis*; it was published after Wilde death, in 1905.
When he was released, he was a broken man, and he could bear the scandal of his situation, his wife obviously refused him, so he went into exile in France, where he lived the last years of his life, in poverty and under and under an assumed name.

He died in 1900 of meningitis, and he was buried in Paris in the same cimitero of Baudelaire, who strongly influenced Wilde’s life and art.


## Art for Art's sake
* ==p. 125==

The concept of Art for Art's Sake' was not merely an aesthetic one. Wilde believed that only art as the cult of beauty could prevent the murder of the soul. He perceived the artist as an alien in a materialistic world, he wrote only to please himself and was not concerned about communicating his theories to his fellow-beings. His pursuit of beauty and fulfilment was the tragic act of a superior being inevitably rejected as an outcast.

## The rebel and dandy
* ==p. 125==

Wilde adopted the 'aesthetic ideal', as he affirmed in one of his famous conversations:
> My life is like a work of art!

He lived the double role of rebel and dandy. Wilde's dandy is an aristocrat whose elegance is a symbol of the superiority of his spirit; he uses his wit to shock and he is an individualist who demands absolute freedom. Since life was meant for pleasure, and pleasure was an indulgence in the beautiful, Wilde's interest in beauty - clothes, words or physical beauty – had no moral stance. In the _Preface_ to his novel he affirmed:

> There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all?

In this way he rejected the didacticism that had characterised the Victorian novel in the first half of the century.

In his life Wilde embodied the figure of the rebel and of the dandy.
He was a **rebel** for his rebellious attitude towards those false conventions and Prejudices of Victorian Society, which, according to him, represented a form of restraint, on the process of artistic creation
He was also a **dandy** since he paid a lot of attention to his outward appearance, and he was an eccentric and extravagant person, with a strong sense of elegance and sophistication.

## *The Picture of Dorian Gray*
- ==p. 126==
### T: The Preface
* ==p. 127==

This text is really important. He published this novel in 1891 in its final edition. He had previously published it, but it was not appreciated by the literary society, so he decided to include this preface, which had yet been published as an essay for a magazine.
This text is really important since it is considered as the English Manifesto of aestheticism, because it picks out the subject of art and the figure of the artist.

![Schermata 2021-03-18 alle 17.52.40](/assets/Schermata%202021-03-18%20alle%2017.52.40.jpg)

- **line 1**: this mean that artist aim is not to communicate a beautiful message, but to offer an example of beauty
- **line 2**: there is an inversion to put attention on the complement
- **line 4**: the criticism reveals more about the person who is judging than about the object of judgment
- **line 9**: art should never express anything but itself; reader shouldn't find other messages in art
- **lines 11-12**: art is not meant to instruct the reader. He rejected the didacticism, typical of the Victorian Novel; he rejected the idea that art could be used as a took for social education: he wanted to free art from this responsibility
- **lines 14-17**: these sentences are meant to contrast to each other. They both introduce the element of the glass, which, according to some critics, is an anticipation of Dorian's use of the mirror
- **line 23**: Wilde us emphasising the same concept
- **line 25**: he makes no judgment of what's right and what's wrong; artist is the creator of beautiful things, and he is not interested in communicating its own idea to mankind, he wrote only to please himself: all the artists should do so
- **line 39**: art exist for its own sake, and not for any moral purpose; the purpose of art is to have no purpose.

This text is rich in repetitions, which emphasizes the author theme.

This preface is important since it is considered the English manifest of Aestheticism. He explains his a philosophy of Art for Art’s sake.

The word art and artist are repeated 11 times each, while the adjective beautiful is repeated 6 times.

This preface is a list of aphorisms, which is a clever saying expressing a truth; the style is epigrammatic, since these general truths are expressed in a short and amusing way, and the language is abstract and witty.

### Plot

The protagonist of this novel is Dorian Gray: he is a handsome young man, whose beauty fascinates the painter Basil Hallward. This painter is so fascinated by Dorian’s beauty that he decides to fix his beauty forever in a portrait.

When Dorian sees his portrait he becomes aware of his beauty, because until this moment he wasn’t fully aware of its own beauty.

Another key character is Lord Henry Watson, who is a cynical aristocrat, he is an aesthete, who believes in nothing but beauty and youth. He initiates Dorian into the cult of Aestheticism.

Dorian is so enchanted by his beauty that he makes a wish: he wishes that his beauty and his youth can remain forever intact while the portrait ages in his place. By some strange magic this is exactly what happens. With the passing of time, while Dorian’s beauty and youth are preserved intact, the portrait starts to show not only his marks of age, but also the marks and the signs of the immoral life that Dorian is living under the influence of Lord Henry Watson.

In the novel Lord Henry Watson provides Dorian with an unnamed book, that was probably *A rebour*, written by the Belgian writer Huysmans in 1887; it describes the strange sensual experiences of its protagonist, Des Esseintes, who becomes the stereotype of the aesthete of _fin de siecle_ literature.

Under the influence of Lord Henry Watson, Dorian Gray embarks on a life of vice and sensual reputation: he becomes more and more involved in ambiguous adventures and he also provokes the suicide of Sybil Vane, the girl who passionately love him.

Then Dorian becomes aware of the immorality of his actions, and he realises that the only way to put an end to his bad behaviour is destroying the portrait, which he feels responsible for his actions. By stabbing the portrait he also kills himself (and this is the end of the novel).

The character of Dorian Gray embodies a typical Dandy, and so we can trace a parallelism between this characters and two others literary figures: Andrea Sperelli (from *Il piacere*) and Des Esseint (from *A rebour*). They are three dandies who live their life looking for beauty and elegance. Their immoral experiences are described by these authors using a refined language.

### T: The Painter’s Studio
* ==p. 129==

This extract is from the first novel chapter. The narrator is a third person narrator, who is unobtrusive, since he never interveins in the narration, and he never addresses the readers directly. This extracts introduces two of the main characters of the novel: one is Basile Hallward, who is the painter and an intellectual who tends to isolate himself from the rest of the world; the other is Lord Henry Watson, who is a brilliant talker, his way of speaking is humorous and satirical: he is only apparently superficial, and in fact in the novel he is able to develop a strong criticism for some Victorian institutions, such as marriage, religion and morality.

The characters are introduced by what they say or what they do, or by what other people say about them, and not by the narrator.
The technic adopted by Wilde is more typical of drama.

![Schermata 2021-03-18 alle 17.57.21](/assets/Schermata%202021-03-18%20alle%2017.57.21.jpg)![Schermata 2021-03-18 alle 17.57.35](/assets/Schermata%202021-03-18%20alle%2017.57.35.png)

This abstract can be divided into three section


The first section deals with the **description of Basil's studio**. The atmosphere is sensual and decadent, while the setting is vividly described with words appealing to all the senses:
- orang epart: smell
- green part: hearing
- gray part: sight
- blue part: touch

There is a possible influence to the sense of taste (at **line 6**) with the words referred to _honey_.


The second section is the **portrait of a young man**.
The reader is introduced to this portrait, which is so important that we can consider it as a character of the novel.

The portrait is located at the center of the room, which is a metaphor of the centrality of the portrait in the novel's pot.

We don't know the identity if the man who is portrayed, but we only know that he is beautiful; the readers come to know about this **directly**, at **line 16-17** (_young man of [...]_) and **indirectly**, at **line 21** (_a smile of pleasure_).

The third section is **Basil and Henry dialogue**
The dialogue is about the portrait; it's almost a prologue to the story itself.

It opens with Henry's opinion about the portrait: he says that this is Basil's best work (in yellow there is the conversation; in light blue the actions).

According to Henry the portrait should be shown in an Art Gallery (a proper one): this is an example of **disapplied logic** (**line 25-26**);
he says something which seems to be logic, but actually it isn't.

Henry speaks through paradoxes and irony, just as Oscar Wilde did. Many critics see behind Henry Wotton the author himself.

According to Henry you must show art.
In this case the painter doesn't agree with him, since he doesn't want to show the portrait, since he finds that he has put too much of himself in it.

Basil doesn't want to disclose the identity of the man who is portrayed, because he is afraid that this portrait might reveal his secret artistic idolatry for Dorian Gray.
This idolatry doesn't seem to be purely professional. It also has personal implications (homosexual connotation)

### T: Dorian Death
* ==p. 131==

This extract is from the end of the novel. It begins with a positive note: it is a lovely warm evening, and Dorian Gray is walking home, in a leasurly way: than he starts thinking about his bad behaviour, and at this point of the novel, Dorian would like to clean his conscience.

In order to do so, he decides that he won't never tempt innocence again: there is a girl who has fallen in love with him, and he tries to convince her that he is a wicked man. This girl refuses to believe him, because he's not old and ugly, as all wicked people were, according to her.

Dorian Gray wants to change, and so he decides not to tempt this girl. He hopes that some improvements might appear on the portrait.
1. He blames his own pride and passion for this situation.
2. He blames the fact that he has received no punishment to purify him.
3. Finally he blames his own beauty and youth

When analyzing his situation, Dorian doesn't consider himself guilty for the death of Basil Hallward and Alan Campbell.
At a certain point of the novel Basil decides to confront Dorian, because terrible things are been said about him. Rumors say that he has a bad and destructive influence on people, that Basil refuses to believe that this rumors are true: he asks Dorian to show him is real soul. Dorian shows him his portrait, because he feels that the portrait is the reflection of his soul.
Then Dorian is forced to kill Basil, in order to prevent him from telling other people how his portrait has become.

He considers that the murder of Basil is just a moment of madness.

Alan Campbell was a talented Chemist, and Dorian blackmails him because he wants to use his skills as chemist to get rid of Basil's body.
Alan accomplish this task unhappily, and then he committed suicide. Since he committed suicide, Dorian doesn't feel responsible for Alan own actions.

He decides he won't tempt innocence, which is the only good thing he did. He look at picture and sees no improvement in the picture.
The reasons of this is that apparently good act is actually a pure act of vanity, and it might be an other expression of his desire to investigate all possibilities offered by life. Dorian feel entitled to experience everything that life could offer to him: he becomes more and more involved in sophisticated adventures, but also in bad experiences.
This decision not to tempt innocence might also be a consequence of his passion to act apart.

When he looks at the portrait, he sees no sign of improvement, his reaction is not of remorse, but of pain and indignation.

For a moment he considers the possibility of confessing his crimes, but then he immediately rejects this idea, because he thinks that nobody will believe him, since he has been so careful of getting rid of evidence.

![Schermata 2021-03-18 alle 18.00.21](/assets/Schermata%202021-03-18%20alle%2018.00.21.jpg)
![Schermata 2021-03-18 alle 18.00.38](/assets/Schermata%202021-03-18%20alle%2018.00.38.png)
![Schermata 2021-03-18 alle 18.00.51](/assets/Schermata%202021-03-18%20alle%2018.00.51.jpg)

Before reaching the decision to destroy the portrait, his mind goes through a series of steps.
* __line 15-16__: nostalgia for his pure boyhood
* __line 16-20__: awareness of his corruption
* __line 21-23__: Dorian recollects his pact to keep eternal youth
* __line 23-25__: his wish for repentance and purification
* __line 34-38__: he reaches the awareness that beauty and youth have caused his ruin
* __line 39-40__: Dorian expresses his wish to free himself from the past (which is also evidente in **line 50**)
* **line 50-56**: Dorian doubts about his salvation
* **line 62-76**: Dorian understands that repentance was just a pure illusion
* **line 96-99**: Dorian finally comes to the decision to destroy the picture: he stabs the portrait, but in doing so he also kills himself, because the portrait is the reflection of his own soul. In fact one of the main themes of the novel (along with beauty and art) is also **duplicity**

==**Duplicity**==: This story is a novel about a split identity; we can read this novel as an allegorical representation of the legend of Faust (by Marlow): he was a man who sells his soul to the Devil in order to all his desires satisfied. There are some differences:
1. Dorian makes a pact with an absent devil
2. Dorian gets eternal beauty and youth

In the end Dorian dies, and the portrait recovers all its past perfection: in this novel it is art that wins in the end.
Dorian turns into a disgusting old man, and when the servants find his body, they are able to recognize him only by his rings.

Wilde's intention was not to write a moral novel, even if the main character actually seems to be punished in the end. For Oscar Wilde art shouldn't deal with morality: the artist may consider the moral and immoral life of people as materials for his art, but there is no judgment. Art is not supposed to teach anything: those who try to go beneath the surface of a work, do so at their own risk.

## Victorian Drama
* ==p. 31==

Very little drama or not was produced in the Victorian period: the decline in the production of dramatic words is caused by:
1. predominance of the novel
2. the power acquired by the theatrical managers, who preferred to stage well known traditional plays, rather than try out new ones; many companies mainly performed Shakespeare, although with many of the text cut or even changed, in order to better suit the victorian tastes
3. many victorians did not appreciate drama as a form of art, since they still consider actor and actresses as people of little respectability and doubtful morality

There is one great innovation, related to the Victorian playhouse: the new theaters became smaller but more pretentious; they could be afforded only by the well off.

The typical features of the Victorian playhouse:
* semicircular
* lighted by gas light and later on by electricity, while the audience was left in darkness
* the stage was separated from the audience by a curtain, and this allowed the scenery to be changed

The new playhouses tended towards a more realistic staging, which made more use of actions and movement, and of setting. The keyword was to **reach the illusion of reality**.
The stage directions became longer and much more detailed.

On the one hand, through the use of this theatrical machinery, the staging was more spectacular but on the other hand there were also some negative consequences:
* this type of staging was more expensive: for the theatrical manager it became unprofitable to stage different plays during the same theatrical season
* the victorian age was a period of great performers, so actors and actresses demanded a higher salary for their job.

This finally leads to a lost of flexibility, who brought managers to stage traditions well know tragedies instead of new ones.

The **audience** at the time went to the theatre just to be amused, and not to meditate on problems.The type of theatre that the victorians demanded was farce spectacol and above all Melodrama.

This latter kind of theatre, **melodrama** was probably the most appreciated: they are highly schematic plays with stereotypical characters, absurd plots. The common features of all melodrama, is that good must triumph over evil. The victorian appreciated the morality on which melodrama was based, because the spectator could easily identify themself with the hero.
For certain aspects we can say that melodrama returned to the morality plays of the Middle Ages.

There is a more innovating and subversive type of theatre that was emerging at the time, of the form of **music hall**. They are a type of theatrical entertainment, characterized by a mixture of comedy and popular song. Music hall was considered a low form of theatre, also because it dealt with taboo subjects, such as sex. It dealt with these taboo subjects using the tecnique of the _double meaning_.
It was mainly appreciated by the working classes, and even though it was considered a low form of theatre, it was to be of great influence in the 20th century, both on early cinema, especially in the films of _Charlie Chaplin_, and on the work of Samuel Beckett.

After this period of stagnation, in which we have almost a gap in the production of new plays worth of note, with the last quarter of the 19th century, British Drama begins to show the first signs of revival. In fact the 1890s marked a reinessance in English dramatic art.

This period of renaissance in theatre wasn't limited to the British context. Drama was changing and improving all of the Europe, and we can now outline the influences coming from abroad, which had an impact on British drama.

### Chekhov

He was Russian. He replaced the lack of action with a constant inquiring into the psychology of his characters

### Strindberg
He is a Swedish playwright who mixed naturalism with psychology, providing a deeper insight into life, together with penetrating studies of women.

### Ibsen

He is from Norway. He modified the structure of the play by the _retrospective method_: disregarding the traditional method of construction based on 3 phases (_antecedent_, _climax_, _conclusion_), he skipped the antecedent and started just before the climax.
He used the stage as an instrument for social criticism and for attacks on bourgeois hypocrisy.
He confronted his audience with real life problems, without indulging in humour or any other form of relief
Features of Ibsen’s plays:
- introduction of problem drama
- realism in characters and language
- psychological exploration
- rejection of sentimentalism
- rejection of conventional moral ending
- defence of women’s independence
- focus on middle class people
- social commitment

His influence was particularly evidente on the works of **George Bernard Shaw**, who was one of the main British playwright of the period. It is almost ironical to note that Wilde and Shaw had two opposite careers:
- during his life time Oscar Wilde's commedies were highly appreciated; he satires the values of the Victorian upper classes, but he did so in a very subtle way, which did not offend the people he was satirising; it was more Wilde's life and his homosexuality that made people turn the vindictively against him
- Shaw was an highly respected people, he was the model of decency, but his plays were not appreciated at the time, because they criticize to harshly the society of the time. He saw the theatre as an instrument for social and political change.
On the contrary Wilde denied the moral significant of art.

## Wilde's plays

### The importance of being Ernest
- ==p. 136-137==

It was published in 1895, but before this commedy Wilde also wrote other very succesful comedies, such as
- Lady Windermere's Fan (1892)
- A Woman of No Importance (1893)
- An Ideal Husband (1895)

All these comedies revived the atmosphere of the comedy of manners. They contain witty epigrams, which give a vivid picture of the contemporary upper classes.
The society plays are different: the first three are more sentimental and melodramatic.

_The Importance of Being Earnest_ is more brilliant and unconventional. The theatrical elements are better balanced

In _The importance of Being Earnest_ sentimentalism and melodrama are replaced by frivolous situations. The characters are sketched, the language is sparkling and it is rich in paradoxes and nonsense. No moral judgment ever intrudes, we only have a gentle satire on the Victorian upper classes.

The main and secondary plots interweave in perfect unity and the characters are vividly sketched.
The language is sparkling and rich in witticism, epigrams, paradoxes and nonsense.

Considering the title of the comedy, it contains a pun. Earnest means honest, but it is pronounced as the proper name Ernest.

The 4 characters are all well-off and members of aristocracy;
- Gwendolen is resolute and helpful
- Cecily is hurt and surprised
- Jack is hesitant, nervous and indifferent with Algernon
- Algernon is disconcerted and detached; indifferent to external problems, he is frivolous and superficial

The two girls join forces against the two men. The two pairs react to the discussion of serious problems by doing trivial things

The serious problems are:
- identity
- marriage
- social status
- property
- baptism

The stage directions provide comments on the characters’ reactions. The wish of the two men of being baptized may be the symbol of their turning their backs on their old life and facing their new-married-life in an appropriate state of earnestness.

Wilde’s two main targets of this play are social hipocrisy and the mercenary marriage market of the high society of his age. His satire is good-humoured, the plot makes fun of the conventions of the day, the education, the relations between romantic love and the simplicity of the country.

#### Plot

All the characters present themselves as polite and sincere but actually they are manipulative
and calculating. This comedy is centred on two main characters, Jack Worthing and Algernon Moncrief, they
both live double lives. Jack lives in the country but he often go to London to visit his fictitious brother Ernest. Algernon lives in London but he often goes to the country to visita fictitious old friend, the
Bunbury.

On one of his visits to London, Jack falls in love with a giri, Gwendolen. Algernon during a visit in the country, falls in love with Cecily, Jack's ward (a person who is looked after a person which his not her parent) and she thinks that Algernon is actually Jack's
brother Ernest. At a certain point of the story both Gwendolen and Cecily believe they are engaged to Ernest, there are many comic complications but in the end it transpires that Jack as a baby was left in a handbag in the station, Algernon is his brother and also Jack's name is indeed Ernest. In the end he can assume his name Ernest and he becomes earnest.
The two couples are reconciled and they can finally start a new life in a state of earnestness.
This comedy can be read in different levels:
- As a farse which plays on mistaken identities and misunderstandings
- Parody of romantic love, it mocks the idea of love at first sight, the two women seem to be
more in love with the name Ernest rather than with the boy they are in love with. The structure
of social relations is reduced to a question of names.
- At a deeper level this comedy is a social satire on the Victorian moral values placed on
appearances, apparently the comedy is a hard less amusing work but at a deeper level Wilde
actually dealt with serious themes such as identity, marriage, social status, property and
baptism. In the end the two men want to be baptised as Ernest, they want to turn their back
on their old lives and they want to start a new life.

#### T: The Interview
- ==p. 137==

Gwendolen's mother is testing him trough a series of persona! questions to test Jack. The first part deals with Lady Bracknell's most important topics, smoking and money, the second section deals with Lady Bracknell's least important topic, family

![Schermata 2021-03-18 alle 18.07.05](/assets/Schermata%202021-03-18%20alle%2018.07.05.jpg)![Schermata 2021-03-18 alle 18.07.19](/assets/Schermata%202021-03-18%20alle%2018.07.19.jpg)

- In yellow we have the topics of conversation, they talk about education, age, smoking, incarne, possession and family,
- in pink we have the social cliches connected to the fact that the characters belong to the upper classes
- green dots refers to the woman's point of view on Jack's origins,
- words underlined in blue contains Lady Bracknell's remarks which reveals that she is bossy and frivolous and arrogant;
- light blue contains the paradoxes used by Lady Bracknell,
- in green we have Jack's concern for upper class' values,
- the red dots refers to what Jack has to do if he wants to marry Gwendolen.

On **Line 39/40** we have a comic effect which is createci by the confusion of the common meaning of the verb "to lose" and its idiomatic sense in the expression of "to lose one's parents" (orphan).

The language is sophisticated and artificial, perfect for the characters of the upper classes.
Marriage as a tool to achieve social status.

The **most important themes** are:
- the institution of marriage
- criticism about Victorian prudery and exaggerated seriousness, hypocrisy and absurdity
- appearance is another important feature of the play

# William Butler Yeats

He was born in Dublin in **1865** into an anglo irish protestant family, when he was a child his family moved to London but he used to spend many holidays in Sligo, a town in Western Ireland that he loved and wrote about.
He grew up feeling as much Irish as English and in Sligo he developed a passion for the Celtic past and also an interest in the occult and the mystical.

In **1880** his family moved back to Dublin where he studied art but he soon realised that his real passion was poetry. He abandoned art as a profession in favour of literature.

In **1889** he met Maud Gonne, she was a beautiful actress and she was his first love, he deeply fell in love with her but his love was not returned, she admired his poetry but she refused his offers of marriage. She carne to represent for Yeats the ideal of beauty.

In the **1890s** he became involved in the **Irish nationalist movement**, he met Lady Gregory, an Irish nationalist and playwright, they became close friend and together they founded the **Abbey Theatre** in Dublin in 1904 which became the most important cultural centre of the Irish literary reinassance.

In addition to his poetry he devoted significant energy to writing plays, but his theatrical production lacked dramatic values, the essential qualifications of a dramatist.

In **1917** he got married with Georgie Hyde Lees, she was a medium who shared his interest in the occult and soon after their wedding she developed the power of automatic writing. She began to utter strange phrases and she thought that these phrases were dictated by spirits from another world.
Yeats copied down these fragments and he incorporateci them in his prose work _A Vision_ in 1925. In this work he also exposed his complex system of ideas.

Between 1922 and 1928 he became a senator in the Parliament of the recently established Free State.

In 1923 his greatness received international recognition with the **Nobel Price for literature**.
He died in France in 1939 just before the outbreak of World War II.

We can divide his literary production into 3 periods:
1. **Early Period** (1886-1900): influence of Romanticism, Aestheticism and French Symbolism, they are also pervaded by a Celtic mysticism, he looked for his themes in Irish legends, interested in the simple impulses of men. The best remedy for the emptiness of the present seem to lie in a return to the simplicity of the past.
2. **Middle Period** (1900-1916): his poems became more and more rooted in reality, in particular in the political situation of Ireland, which was under the British rule. It is in this phase that he becomes a true modern poet, his poetry is no longer concerned with the representation of a personal suggestive dreamlike world. His poetry became concerned with the search for truth. He confronted reality and imperfection, his poetry showed a gradual movement away from Escapism of his previous works. He shows a growing carriage in
considering the modern problems.
3. **Late Period** (1917-1939): it is his maturity. His poems became more introspective, meditating on memory, old age and death. Symbolic interpretation of history and man's destiny. He was a symbolist and his poet is not simple, he adopted a complex system. This was developed from his study on mystic ancient philosophy, esoteric, astrology and magic. After his marriage he started to experiment automatic writing, they used to sit together for writing sessions during which they believed to be guided by a spiritual world. He wanted to resolve the contradictions of the modern world.

## Themes

He deals with a wide variety of themes, one of the reasons for his greatness is that we can identify many different aspects in this author. He is a multidimensional poet, not characterised by a single approach to poetry.

### The faith in beauty and eternity of art

This was developed under the influence of the Romantic poets Keats and pre-Raphaelites.

### Relationship between the poetano irish people ano tradition

This developed from a very early age, he felt a deep connection to Ireland, with a strong interest in Irish mythologies.

### Age

Yeats was almost obsessed with age.
His preoccupation with old age is based on the contrast between the failing body and the willing heart.

<!-- pagebreak -->

### Death

It's another key theme. Yeats view was that unlike the animals, that dies once and forever, man dies many times before his real death.

Every defeat, as well as every victory, represents a series of death and rebirth, prefiguring the end of life.
This continuos cycle of Death and Rebirth is promoted by an incessant and endless process of change and renewal

### Idea of the heroic individual

Loneliness is a feature of his hero; he has superior qualities, that distinguish him from the common men.

Yeats develop the image of the solitary soul.

### Polarity between opposites concepts

such as the physical and the spiritual, the real and the imagined.

### Deep fascination for occultism

Yeats was a believer in magic and similar arts, he was a visionary, he was religious by temperament but he was unable to believe in christian orthodoxy

All his life he tried to compensate his lost sense of religion, and this search led him to various kind of mysticism and spiritualism, neoplatonism, and also to **theosophy**.

In London he joined the Theosophical society, whose mysticism appealed to Yeats; this mysticism was based on a form of immaginative life.
Theosophy is the belief in a deeper spiritual reality.

According to Yeats people can came in contact with this deeper reality through
- intuition
- meditation
- revelation
- use of symbols

Yeats develop its own symbolic system, which is exposed in his book _A Vision_. This book represents the full exposition of his philosophy and his ideas. It is still a very obscure book, and in fact it led to describe Yeats as one of the most difficult among the modern poets.

Yeats distinguish between two kind of symbols: emotional and intellectual;
- **emotional symbols** evocke emotions
- **intellectual symbols** evoque ideas

Symbols are to primary importance to Yeats, since they contribute to the definition of a collective consciousness.

In this regards Yeats develop the concept of the great memory, that is a concept that is strongly connected to the Jung's concept of the Collective unconscious.
They both believe that we interact with the world through a system of archetypes, which express a set of human truth, that are passed on from generation to generation

The reader’s difficulties in reading Yeats arrive mainly from Yeats’s use of the same symbol to represent a variety of things.
One of his main theme is the falcon which represents a violent break from any form of control but it also represent grace
Another important symbol is the swan. On one hand it represents a perfect unchanging ideal while, on the other hand, it becomes a symbol of destructive
power.
The tower is another famous symbol . The tower can be an intellectual shelter but sometimes it becomes a vision of the dark future of humanity

## Style

His style is characterized by a great variety of forms, rhythms and tone.
Stylistically Yeats is at the same time a traditionalist and an innovator: he worked with traditional genres, but he disrupted conventions by breaking the coherence of this more traditional form.

Also stylistically Yeats tries to convey a tension between opposite concepts, by making a large use of antithesis, oximoron and paradoxes.

## T: _Easter 1916_

- ==p. 198==

![Schermata 2021-04-25 alle 13.17.53](/assets/Schermata%202021-04-25%20alle%2013.17.53.jpg)
![Schermata 2021-04-25 alle 13.18.06](/assets/Schermata%202021-04-25%20alle%2013.18.06.png)

This poem was written after the Easter Rising, an insurrection which took place in Ireland in 1916.
During the Easter week in 1916 some rebels decided to sid Dublin strategic point while the british were fighting in WWI

But the British troops were able to intervene and to repress these protests. Some were executed and many citizens were arrested. This rebellion didn’t directly lead Ireland to reach independence but it represented an important step in order to reach it.
After the execution carried out by the British the Irish became increasingly hostile towards the british Rule and so they started to further promote the cause of their independence.

In the election of 1918 the Sein Fein party won the largest proportion of the Irish seats in the British Parliament. This Party decided to form its own governement, with the help of IRA. This was led to the anglo-irish treaty, that marked the birth of the Irish free state.

This poem expresses the poet's contrasted feelings respect the up rising which took place in Dublin in 1916.

The themes are
- heroism
- bravery
- public sacrifice
- death
- mourning

Yeats uses a chain of multiple unanswered questions to express his difficulty in finding the appropriate response to this historical event.

The **first stanza** is based on a series of contrasts:
1. between two different subject's pronoun: "_I_" (**line 1**) refers to Yeats, he was a witness [testimone] to the Easter Rising; "_them"_ (**line 1**) refers to the Irish insurgence, that Yeats used to meet at the end of the day
2. between the insurgence _vivid faces_ (**line 2**) and the _grey Eighteenth-century houses_ (**line 3-4**)
3. there is a contrast between these people and the poet, because the _vivid faces_ of these people might have easily revealed some internal agitation, but when meeting them, the poet proved unable to take their passion seriously, he didn't feel close to their internal agitation: he just acknowlegde them with a nod, or he exchange some meaningless small talk, just to be polite; sometimes he even mocked them with his friends; for Yeats all these people were just living their normal life, but then something happen, and everything change

In the **second stanza** the poet became more specific about the people he used to meet, he provides us with some details and personal information about some of the rebels.

The **third stanza** opens with a reference to the hearts that have only one aim, referring to the rebels and to their single-minded dedication. Yeats is suggesting that those people who totally devote themselves to some unchanging goals, may finally lose their ordinary human feelings, to the point that their heart is like a stone travelling the _living stream_.
This _living stream_ (**line 44**) stands for the flowing of life while the hearts with one purpose refers to the rebels, who dedicate all their energy to one single goal.

This _stone_ (**lines 43-47**) might also be read as an allusion to the anglo-irish conflict. Yeats is developing the idea that everything changes in nature, in order to adapt to the situation, whereas stones simply exist to the same state on a endless basis.

People who devote themself to unchanging goals might finally end up in being like stones, because they lose their most peculiar human feature, that is the ability to change and to adapt for their own survival.

In the **fourth stanza** the poet wonders whether the rebels sacrifice was useful and worthwhile.

Maybe it is possible that England, would have granted Ireland it's independence without this violent rebellion.
Many people were killed.

Yeats affirms that it is not up to him to establish this. It's God who has to answer this question, and our duty is just to honor the rebels memory, and remember the rebels with respect.

To emphasize the respect that people should owe to the rebels, Yeats uses a symbolic image.
He says that our attitude towards the death rebels should be the same attitute of a mother when taking care of her sleeping child, looks at him and says name, with the utmost love and utmost seriousness.
Yeats is also making an associaton with this symbol, establishing a link between death and sleep, which reveals a conforting idea of death, and which has christian implication.

Then Yeats immediately rejects this idea, because the rebels are truly dead, and this is not something temporary, so it is not the case to soften the harshness of the reality.

At **line 74** Yeats states the act he is performing. He wrote this line to celebrate the rebels who sacrificed their lives to a dream.
This line bridges the poet, the heroes and the readers.

At **line 75-76** he mentions some of the insurgence, and by directly naming them, we see how, through the poem, these insurgence have gone through a radical process of transformation to the eyes of the poet.
From the idea of ordinary people, they ended up as heroes to be honoured at the end of the poem, because they nobly die for their cause, and they deserve being remembered.

The poem ends with a line which is repeated at the end of the first and the second stanza. These lines contains and oximoron (_terrible // beauty_). This line is a sort of refrain [ritornello] that clearly conveys the feelings of the poet about the sacrifice implied in the change.
Yeats attitude oscillates between a feeling of ammiration for their bravery and a feeling of conflict for the cost of their commitment.
In the end he cannot say if the rebels sacrifies was worth the cost.
His attitude is ambivalent and characterised by approval and disapproval at the same time.
This line perfectly registers the contrast between the nobility of the rebels cause and the devastating price they payed for it. This line also perfectly register the poet's uncertainty about how to make sense of had happened.

Yeats was a symbolist, and in this poem he proves his ability as a symbolist, by recurring to some symbols that convey powerful meanings, sometimes contrasting each other:
- the **stone**: it may stand for the Anglo-Irish conflict, it may stand for the rebel's heart: this association can have both negative and positive connotations
  - the positive connotations refer to the idea of strength that a stone implies
  - the negative connotations refer to the static nature of stones: to the steady focus on the cause for independence, although it is actually a noble dream, has made the rebel's heart stone-like; their fixation ended up bringing violence and destruction;
- the **stone** might also symbolize both the admiration and the criticism for the rebels by Yeats
- the **sleeping child**: this image is used to refer to the death rebels; sleep is a common metaphor for death in poetry, and the image of child implies an idea of innocence; just like children can sometimes unintentionally produce some harm, so the rebel are not guilty, because they didn't intend to cause any harm for fighting for their independence
- the **mother**: it can be read as a symbol for Ireland itself; according to this interpretation, the rebels can be imagined as Ireland's children

## T: _The Second Coming_
- ==p. 200==

![Schermata 2021-04-25 alle 13.21.57](/assets/Schermata%202021-04-25%20alle%2013.21.57.jpg)

This is one of Yeats' most famous poem, belonging to the last period of his career.

It was written in 1919, and it was published after a series of bloodshed:
- two years after the Russian revolution
- the end of WWI
- the conflict between Irish patriots and English government was at its pick

Its conclusion also seems to predict the rise of Hitler and the nazi party.

Portraying a world on the edge of catastrophe, this poem is deeply pessimistic about the new phase that the world is entering.

To fully understand this poem, it is useful to look at Yeats' view of history. He is influenced by the cyclical theory of the Italian philosopher Gian Battista Vico.
Yeats always professes to see the world as in a state of perpetuale flux: in this regard, his idea of history was based on what he called **gyres**.
A gyre is a geometric figure composed of two cones, rotating in opposite directions.
According to Yeats history is made of different historical phases, which he calls gyres, usually contrasting with each other.

Each historical phase is followed by an other one which has contrasting elements, in comparison to the previous one. Each dominant historical phase always contains its antithesis.

The title of this poem evokes the second coming of Christ, predicted by Matthew in the Bible. According to it Jesus Christ is supposed to return, and save those who deserve being saved, the true believers, bringing them to heaven.

The second coming described by Yeats is not referred to Christ: he perceives that some rough beast, which he cannot name, is waiting to be born. This image of the **rough beast** clearly suggest that this second coming will not be that of Christ, but that of an Anti-Christ.

The **first stanza** describes a world characterized by anarchy and blood. The picture introduced is one of violence and change.
- **line 3**: _Things fall apart_: chaotic world
- **line 3**: _the centre cannot hold_: society lacks of foundations
- **lines 4-5**: idea of blood, physical pain and violence, idea of mass destruction
- **line 6**: humanity supposed arc of progress as being a pure illusion
- **line 7**: _The best lack all conviction_: best people are not motivated
- **lines 7-8**: _while the worst Are full of passionate intensity_: worsts are eager to act; the worsts are those who react with passionate physical intensity and not with careful intellectual study
These two lines suggests a dissociation between best people (intellectual) and the crowd

The lines of this stanza can be read almost as a commentary on the times. The first stanza expresses the disintegration of our civilization. To describe this disintegration Yeats uses a series of images
- **the falcon** _turning and turning in the widening gyre_ represents the cycle of history that is disintegrating
- **the falcon** who _cannot hear the falconer_ stands for lack of communication

The **second stanza** describes a nightmarish picture connected to the second coming.
It predicts the beginning of a new age, a sort of anti-christian age, characterized by violence, lack of values and lack of communication.
- **lines 9-10** are rich in repetitions.
All these repetitions create a sort of onomatopeic effect, that suggest the repetitive movement of the gyre.
The poet is sure that there will be soon some revelation, the **second coming**, a new cycle in history

The poet has a vision, an image coming from the _Spiritus Mundi_ emerges in the poet's mind. This _Spiritus Mundi_ it's the soul of the universe to which men are connected through the great memory: it's a sort of universal subconscious, were the memories of the human race are preserved: it's similar to Jung's idea of the Collective Unconscious.

The main symbol we find here is the **rought beast**. Many critics remark that this poem is deeply concerned with the drama of modern war.
Yeats himself described his poem as a reaction to the growing murderousness of the world.
This concern with war marks this poem as a modern work.
- **lines 13-17**: describes a creature which is half human and half lion (it's a vision of the poet); it has the body of a Lion and the head of a man. This creature appears in the desert, and in the poet's eyes it has a blank and pityless look.
The rough beast that has the intellect of a man and the fierce emotion of a beast.

Some critics have also connected this __rough beast__ with the figure of Hitler, and it is prophetic, since it predicts the rise of Nazism. Perhaps connecting this image to a single historical figure or event is reductive, because for Yeats this rough beast is fearful image which arises out of the collapse of the existing order.
This creature arises from the fact the _Things fall apart_ and _the centre cannot hold_ (**line 3**). Yeat's vision offers a more general vision of evil.
- **line 18**: poet's vision ends and the poet starts thinking again
- **line 19**: it refers to the christian age: the poem is about the disintegration of the christian age
- **line 20**: it’s a puzzling line because the “rocking cradle” suggests the manger where Jesus was laid
- **lines 21-22**: the poem ends with the image of the rough beast going to Bethlehem to be born; the creature is going to desecrate the holy play where Jesus was born.

This poem is an apocalyptic vision of the future of mankind.

The poem is meter irregular, and it doesn't have a fixed rhyme scheme. Describing a world of chaos, anarchy and confusion, it make sense that the poem doesn't follow a standard scheme or fixed rhyme pattern, which would convey an idea of order, balance and linearity

# Thomas Stearns Eliot

He is one of the most significant figure of the 20th century, he is one of the great innovator of the 20th century: he was a **poet**, a **playwright**, but also a **literary critic**.
He wrote almost nothing negligible.

He was born in Missouri, in **1888**. He study at Harvard and at the Sorbonne in Paris and at Oxford: those giving a cosmopolitan bent to his education.

At the outbreak of WWI he settled in London where he started to work first as a teacher and then as a Bank Clerk.

In **1914** he met the american poet **Ezra Pound**, with whom he would work closely on several major poems.
In **1915** he married Viven Haigh-Wood: she was a British ballad dancer, but the marriage was not a success since she suffered from mental instability.
In **1917** he published his first collection of poems _Prufrock and Other Observations_, which establish Eliot as an important avant-garde poet, with its vocal fragmentation and allusiveness, with its precision of imagery, its condemnation of the modern world, together with the ricorrence to a dry selfconscious wit, this poem establish Eliot as a modernist poet.

In **1922** he founded the influential literary journal _The Criterion_, which he also edited during the 17 years of its publication.
In **1925** he became director of the publishing house _Faber and Faber_.

After the publication of its first collection of poems, unhappily married, Eliot suffered from a nervous breakdown, and he spends some time in a sanatorium in Switzerland, where he underwent psychological treatment.
During this period poetry became officially its only shelter, as well as the tool to transcend his personal situation and to represent the general crisis of western culture.

In Switzerland he completed his famous poem _The Waste Land_ which was published in the first issue of _The Criterion_ after Ezra Pound revision and cuts. Eliot later dedicated this poem to his friend Ezra Pound.
This poem explored the disintegration of values in the modern world. It was highly innovative and it confirmed Elliot as a major poet and also as a significant spokesman for his generation.

In **1925** he published _The Hollow Man_. This poem can be read as a sequel to the despair expressed in _The Waste Land_.
In **1927** Elliot became a British citizen and it was about this time that he entered the Anglican Church finally finding the answer to his own uncertainties and to the despair of the modern world’s lack of faith and religion. (Eliot is American from birth)

The major works of this period expressed Eliot’s search for religious certainties and they include _Ash-Wednesday_ published in 1939 and the _Four Quartets_ published in 1943.
_Ash-Wednesday_ is a poem with a penitential and questioning mood whereas the _Four Quartets_ deals with the relation between time and eternity.

When his wife’s mental instability got worse Eliot placed her into a mental asylum where she later died provoking a strong sense of guilt in Eliot.
Ten years later he was happily remarried to his secretary.

During the 30’s Eliot also devoted himself to writing verse drama which he also continued writing during the 40’s and the 50’s. He isn’t only a poet, he is also a playwright and a literary critic.
All his plays mainly address directly or indirectly religious themes.

During his life Eliot proved to be an extremely prolific writer. He even wrote a book of poems for children which is called _Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats_ in 1939. This book was later transformed into the highly successful musical _Cats_.

During his life Eliot also wrote several works of criticism. He was an influential **literary critic** and in his critical essays he shared with the modern novelist **James Joyce** the view about the importance for the artist to be impersonal and to separate the man who suffers from the mind which creates.
He believed that the artist had to separate the man who suffers from the mind which he
creates.

The characters of his works are often archetypes of human beings who turn their own subjective experience into a universal form which anyone can identify with.
His idea was that impersonality must prevail over personality.

In 1948 he was awarded the **Nobel Prize for Literature** and he was internationally recognised as one of the most important poets of the century.
He died in London in 1965.

## Works

Eliot wrote in a period when new techniques were needed to express the complex realities of the so-called **Age of Anxiety**.

Even though a definitive interpretation of his work is not possible we can roughly divide his literary production into 2 periods: before and after his conversion to the Anglican Church.

### Before his conversion to the anglican church
The works of the first period show a pessimistic vision of the world and the main works belonging to this first phase are _Prufrock and Other Observations_, _The Waste Land_ and _The Hollow Man_.
All these poems expressed a certain nihilism (existence is useless) and reflects the sense of spiritual dryness of modern man.
### After his conversion to the anglican church
The works of the second period show a more optimistic vision. After entering the anglican Church his religious faith gave him an optimistic vision of the world and so from a mood of desolation Eliot turned into an ardent believer in Christian faith.

The main works belonging to this second phase are _The four quartets_, _Ash-Wednesday_ and his verse poems.

---

With his works Eliot represented the complexity of modern civilization. For Eliot this complexity resulted from the fragmentation of Western tradition which was the result of the Modern processes of industrialization, mass production and consumerism.

Alienated modern man no longer experiences a coherent sense of moral and religious community with his fellow man. His actions are no longer governed by a shared ethical code. The modern man is morally and spiritually empty.

Eliot sees his poetic mission as that of pissing together these broken worlds and finding redemption by creating a new symbolic system but inevitably such missions lead to a very difficult poetry.

## _The Waste Land_

The main theme is the **opposition** between the **sterility** of the modern world and the **fertility** of the past.

_The Waste Land_ is a complex, erudite, cryptic, spiritually earnest, occasionally lyrical poem, and it is one of the most recognizable poems of Modern Poetry

This poem was first published in 1922, and it was dedicated to Ezra Pound, who also played an important role in the editing of the poem.

This poem was acclaimed as the beginning of a new type of poetry, capable of expressing the post war sense of depression and futility.

With this poem Eliot he diagnosed the collapse of values that followed the bloodshed of WWI; it is characterised by shifting scenarios, multiple voices and changes in form.

The _Waste Land_ is a very long poem, structured in five different sections:
1. The Burial of the Dead
2. A Game of Chess
3. The Fire Sermon
4. Death by Water
5. What the Thunder Said

The first one (**The Burial of the Dead**), dealing with the coming of spring, in a sterile land, is centered on the basic opposition between **sterility** and **fertility**, **life** and **death**.

The second section (**A Game of Chess**) is based on the juxtaposition of present squalor, and past  ambiguous splendor.

**The Fire Sermon** reinforces the theme of squalor, and it introduces Tiresias, which is considered by Eliot the most important character in the poem.

**Death by Water** is based on the idea of purification by water.

**What the Thunder Said** conveys the image of the disintegration of western civilization and it suggest it possible salvation.
A possible solution is found in a sort of simpathy with other human beings, but anyway this solution does not modify the general atmosphere of desolation.

In addition to these five section, _The Waste Land_ also includes Eliot own notes, which explain some of his metaphors, allusions, quotations and half quotations.
Eliot uses several myths, legends and symbols, but he was acutely aware of the difficulty: including some notes aimed explaining his references.

Eliot drew inspiration from a wide range of sources:
- _The Bible_
- Dante's _Divina Commedia_
- Shakespheare
- French Symbolists
- Metaphysical poets, and John Donne
- Homer’s _Odyssey_
- Ovid's _Metamorphoses_
- _The Upanishads_, an Hindu sacred text.

In this regard Eliot openly declares that immature poets borrow, and major poets steal.
He was firmly convinced that past and present must coexist in poetry, and for this reason we are fully entitled to consider him at the same time as the most influential poet, but also as the most influent poet.

According to Eliot a poet should write universal poetry, drawing inspiration from everywhere: from the past, from the present, and from other countries.

### Style

The style of this poem is fragmentary: this stylistic fragmentation is evidente, first of all, from the structure of the poem itself, because although being a very long poem, _The Waste Land_ doesn't show the typical narrative structure of long poems: it seems more to be made up of a series of disjointed verse paragraphs, and the reader cannot easily follow the story.
There is the lack of an explicit link between the episodes described, and the reader cannot easily follow the poem.

Secondly, it sis fragmentary because of the mixture of different poetic style, which are meant to reproduce the chaos of modern civilization.
The poet creates sharp juxtaposition of different registers of speech.

_The Waste Land_ is also highly innovative in his use of language: its vocabulary is made up of words from several different languages: not only english, but even french, latin, german, sanskrit.

An other peculiarity of Eliot's style is that it requires the active participation of the reader, through the technique of implication: rather than using direct statements, Eliot prefers to use metaphor, similis and symbols to evoque emotions.
To this purpose, Eliot adopted what he called the **objective correlative**, which is the attempt at conveying and emotion without a direct explicit statement.
His style is evocative

Eliot Rejected an idea of poetry based on the poet's own personality, and he uses the objective correlative of symbolic meaningful imagery, which forces the reader to contribute to the poem, by bringing its own connotation to the gaps and by bringing its own meaning to the unstated.

### T: _The Burial of Dead_
- ==p. 206==

A funeral service in the Anglican rite is called "The Order of the Burial of the Dead". The title of the first section of _The Waste Land_ refers to it, since it is a metaphor for the condition of modern man, whose life is meaningless, empty, alienating and quite similar to death. In the passage that follows, traditional myths and symbols are used in an original way and acquire different and sometimes difficult connotations. This is why the poet himself added some notes to the edition in which the poem appeared.

![Schermata 2021-04-25 alle 12.45.23](/assets/Schermata%202021-04-25%20alle%2012.45.23.jpg)

This extract contains the beginning of the poem (**lines 1-7**) and the end of the poem's first section (**lines 8-24**)

_The Waste Land_ is a poem with an extraordinary symbolic and rythmical complexity, which breaks into many directions, from its very beginning.
It starts with a reference to April, as the "cruellest month" , while the reader usually associates Aprile to a month of renewal.

Then he breaks again with the common view by saying that Winter, generally associated with cold temperatures, keeps human beings warm, it turns to be positive.

In the second section is focused on the opposition between fertility and sterility, life and death. It contains one of the most surreal episodes of the whole poem: the speaker in fact walks through London, which is mentioned with the expression "unreal city" a reference to Baudelaire who used a similar expression to refer to Paris in one of his poems; London is the symbol of materialism, consumerism, because inhabited by creatures that look like walking ghosts, that stare and sight only in front of their feet. This is an idea of people who are totally absorbed by work that have lost the ability to communicate to each other. This image conveys an idea
of death within life and lack of communication

There is a sensation of unreality, due to:
- presence of people who look like walking ghosts
- presence of a brown fog at dawn which conveys an idea of unreal darkness
- the sound of the clock bell, which is a dead sound; the church bell no longer signife a call to prayer, but it signife a call to work; in the modern world, work has replaced the function of pray;

The speaker recognizes someone he knows among the crowd: he calls him Stetson. This is the name of an american large hat, which is usually wore by cowboys, and for this reason some critics see in this name a valid reference to Eliot's friend Ezra Pound (he used to wear this kind of hat). Eliot actually denied this connection.

The speaker connects his encounter to a memory of the Punic Wars. The two man fought together in the first Punic War (between Rome and Carthage).
This reference to the past world is meant to reproduce the present clashes of WWI.

It is difficult to analyze Eliot's poem, because there are so much references.

The speaker asks Stetson about the fate of a corps planted in his garden: he asks if the buried corps has already began to sprout; it is an ironic and comic description of the burial rite, as a form of gardening.

The section ends with a direct address to the reader:

> 'You! _hypocrite lecteur! - mon semblable, - mon frère!'_

This is a quotation from the preface of _Le fleur du mal_ of Baudelaire.
This final line connect the poet to the reader, since they both share a condition of spiritual emptiness and desolation.

The **style** is highly citatory: in this passage we find references to
- Dante's Inferno (when he describes the crowd of walking ghosts)
- Baudelaire's Parisians poems (at line 8 _unreal city_)
- Baudelaire's preface to _Le fleur du male_ (last line)
- at line 22 we have a reference to a minor 17th century dramatist's tragedy, John Webster's _The white devil_. Webster wrote
  > O Keep the Wolf far hence, that's fought to man

All these quotation make the text very complex, since there can be different levels of reading, according to how many references the reader is able to notice and appreciate.

Eliot makes use of free verse: lines are not of the same length, there is neither a regular scheme nor a traditional meter, and there isn't

- highlighted in **orange**: refers to the typist
- highlighted in **pink**: expression referred to Tiresias
- highlighted in **grey**: expression referred to the typist lover
- **pink** words: refers to the man's action and attitude
- **blue** words: typist's emotions and mood

#### First section

In the first section Tiresias is in London, which is the external setting; he is with Mr Eugenides: he is a merchant, whose name means "well born", someone of noble origin.
Now he is unkempt (trasandato), and he speaks vulgar french.

In this first section Mr Eugenides invites the narrator Tiresias to have lunch together and then he invites him to go to a hotel in Brighton, the Metropole, known for its sexual activity.

This scene evoke past and present time. Smyrna is a very ancient town, located in present Turkey, and so this is the image of an ancient merchant, but also there is the reference to the modern time, from the Hotel.

- **line 9**: _violet hour_: the sunset
- **line 12**: _I Tiresias_: it's the only explicit identification of the speaker

#### Second section

Tiresias assists to a squalid sexual encounter.

The setting in place changes: now the setting is a squalid untidied bedsitter, when we find a typist, who is waiting for her lover.

The setting in time: there is a mixture of past, present and future; Tiresias is a figure who comes from the past, and he has already experienced the events that he is now assisting to.

He is assisting to the squalid sexual encounter, in the present, and at the same time he is able to foretell the future.
Yet he cannot do anything to modify the future, he can only predict it.

Tiresia is an ermafrodite, because he was a man, and then he become a woman, and then he returned a man, so he posses the knowledge of both sexes.

He represents the supreme metamorphosis that brings the two sexes together.
He's qualified to summarize the whole human experience, He's qualified to assist to this sexual encounter.

The typist stands for the liberate woman of the early 1920s. She is independent and free, but this didn't bring her any happiness: she lives alone, in an untidied one room flat, full of uninteresting everyday objects; she lives an highly monotonous life. In this extract she is compared to a human engine, that act with automatic hand

The typist lover is a young man, carbuncular: carbuncul is an infection.

The typist is both morally and emotionally indifferent, bored and tired, but the man is not worried: he is only interested in his own satisfaction, he is only pleased with himself.

When he leaves her, he is satisfied. He is not able to grab the squalor he lived in.

Love is reduced to the fulfilment of mere instincts and physical desire: it's something practical and meaningless.

The typist's reaction to the young man is of pleasure for the end of the sexual encounter.

- **lines 49-50**: Renforces the impression of dullness, monotony and sterility. Their relationship is no more than a parody.

The themes developed are:

**Spiritual sterility and lack of communication**:
Eliot want to underline how impossible communication through love is in the wasteland; love has been reduced to mere lust. Eliot deals with this theme through the **objective correlative**: he describes this sexual encounter with a language that evokes the scene, and he doesn't describe it directly

**Negativity of city life**:
city life is only linked to commercial transactions, and this is evident from some metaphors and symbols that Eliot adopt here:
- **line 5**: _C.i.f._: it stands for "cost insurance and freight", this is a typical term of commercial transactions.
- the **typist**, who is the symbol of the liberated woman of the '20s

**Antithesis between past and present**:
this is evident through the juxtaposition of images belonging to the past and images belonging to the present

# Virginia Woolf

Together with Joyce, Virginia Woolf is considered one of the greatest and innovative novelist of her time. 

She continued Joyce’s experimentation with the stream of Consciousness, but their achievements were quite distinct: Joyce was more concerned with language, while Woolf was more interested in the contrast between outer reality and inner reality.

She was born in London, in 1882, and she didn’t go to school, being educated at home, because her father was an influential literary critic, and he educated Virginia.
She had the opportunity to read a lot in her father’s library, she had the opportunity to meet many men of letters during her life. 

She grew up in a cultural atmosphere of great refinement.

When she was 13 her mother died, and she had a strong breakdown. From that moment the cloud of mental instability shadowed her life. She had hallucinations, she heard phantom voices.

In addition she also suffered form severe migraine attacks.

When her father died, she moved to Bloomsbury, which is a district in London, where she founded a circle of intellectuals, that became known as *The Bloomsbury book*. The group included intellectuals in general, and Virginia Woolf married one of its members, Leonard Woolf, in 1912.

All the members of the book were anti-Victorian and unconventional, both in their view of art and in their way of living.

With her husband she founded The Hogarth Press, a publishing house that published most of her novels.

In 1915 she published her first novel, which is *The Voyage Out*, and then she tried to kill herself. This novel was still traditional, but then this novel was followed by a series of modernist masterpieces

- *Mrs Dalloway* (1925)
- *To the Lighthouse* (1927): is probably Woolf’s most celebrated novel; its most interesting aspect is its treatment of time: the novel is cantered on a single event, a planned excursion to the lighthouse, which happens to be postponed
- *Orlando* (1928): this novel recounts the adventures of Orlando, who is a man who lives over three hundred years; one morning he wakes up and he find out to be a woman; in this novel Virginia Woolf explores the themes of androgyny: the idea she develops is that human personality is too complex to be classified as male or female, and it’s always a combination of female and male aspects
- *The Waves* (1931): its her last novel, and here she draws a link between her creative and artistic process and her mental illness

She was also a great literary critic, and her most important essays are collected in *The Common Reader* (1925)

She is important because she was a supporter of the feminist cause: she wrote two important essays: *A Room of One’s Own* (1929) and *Three Guinaes* (1938), all based on the idea of feminism.

She became more and more subjected to periods of depression, and in 1941 she drowned herself in the River Ouse, near her house. Before committing suicide she wrote a touching letter in which she said she could go on living in that way.
> Death is the only experience I shall never transcribe  

## Features of her novels

1. **Inconsistent plots**: she rejected traditional eventful plot, because she was not interested in external elements, but she was concerned with her characters’ inner life
2. **The shift of the viewpoint inside the characters’ minds**: she was interested in reproducing her characters’ flow of thoughts, memories and reflections
3. **The abandonment of the chronological order of events**, because our mind jumps from past to present and future continously
4. **Highly evocative and figurative language**

Her literary technique was based on the so called **moments of being**: they are the equivalent of Joyce’s epiphany, they are moments of intensity, perception or vision which illuminate our lives

Her task as a writer is taking an ordinary mind on an ordinary day and examine the myriad of impression that the mind receives form the outer world.
> Examine for a moment an ordinary mind on an ordinary day. The mind receives a myriad of impressions. From all sides they come, an incessant shower of innumerable atoms

## *Mrs Dalloway*

The actions of Mrs Dalloway is limited to the events of a single day in central London. The protagonist is Clarissa Dalloway: a middle aged woman, the wife of a politician, and she belongs to the upper-class.

The novel opens on a June morning, as Calarissa leaver her home to buy some flowers for the party she had organised in the evening.
During the day Clarissa is captured in different moods, her thoughts are described, and we also see her through the eyes and thoughts of other characters.

The other main character is Septimus Smith, whose day is contrasted by Clarissa’s day. The novel is based on the contrast between the description of these two days.
He is shell shocked, he is traumatised by the experience of the war, and he is a broken man.
He has been treated for his nervous disorders, first by doctor Holmes, who understood nothing about his pain, and then he has been treated by an other insensitive nerve specialist, Sir William Bradshaw, that wanted to hospitalise him.

At the end of the day Septimus commit suicide, by jumping out of the window of his room.

Clarissa and Septimus belongs to two different narrative lines, but they become linked to each other as Virginia Woolf constantly shift from Clarissa thoughts
Only at the very end of the novel the two different narrative lines intermingled, when we have the **climax the story**, represented by the party scene.
One of the guests of the party is Sir William Bradshaw, and he brought the news of Septimus suicide. Clarissa is quite irritated by this news, because the party was supposed to be a happy moment, but now death is present in the middle of the party.
She goes into a small room and she starts thinking about Septimus’ life, and how intolerable his life was: she experiences a **moment of being**. As he embraces death, she embraces life, she understands the importance of life.
She was almost happy that he committed suicide, since she understood the importance of life. His choosing to die is inseparable for her acceptance of life.

Even if their lives were completely different, they were absolutely linked. Septimus’ death is like the halo that illuminates Clarissa’s life, but these two characters are very different: she shows to be always aware of the contrast between her thoughts and exterior reality, on the contrary Septimus is unable to distinguish between these two different reality, and he is unable to give order to his past experiences and to his thoughts.

### T: *Clarissa and Septimus*

![Schermata 2021-05-30 alle 18.03.21](/assets/Schermata%202021-05-30%20alle%2018.03.21.png)![Schermata 2021-05-30 alle 18.03.29](/assets/Schermata%202021-05-30%20alle%2018.03.29_17bg9tikv.png)

Clarissa Dalloway decides to buy flowers herself for the party she is going to give in the evening. She goes into Mulberry's florist shop and is greeted by Miss Pym. Clarissa enjoys the various perfumes and colours of the many flowers. She suddenly hears a noise similar to a pistol shot in the street. Miss Pym looks apologetic, as if the loud motor cars were her fault.
Clarissa and seeral other people turn to observe the mysterious person passing in a luxury car. They wonder whether it is the Queen or the Prime Minister behind the blinds.
Septimus Warren Smith, a veteran of WWI, also hears the car backfire. He suffers from shell shock, a mental illness caused by the horrors of war, and believes he is responsible for the traffic congestion the passin car causes. His young Italian wife, Lucrezia, is embarassed by his odd manner and also frightened, since Septimus has recently threatened to kill himself.

This extract is divided into five part:

- **line 1-23**: Mrs Dalloway’s visit at the florist’s is interrupted by the explosion of a tyre in the street
- **line 24-37**: various people’s reactions to the explosion and their speculations about who might be in the car
- **line 38-41**: Introduction of Septimus Warren Smith
- **line 42-53**: The busy traffic in the street and Septimus’s thoughts
- **line 54-73**: Description of Lucrezia’s appearance and thoughts. She is worried because Septimus wants to kill himself.

One of the most interesting aspect in reading Woolf’s novel is how she treats time. The **treatment of time** is a fundamental concept that characterised her style.

This extract is from the beginning of the novel: as she walks around London, her physical trajectory towards the flower shop is constantly interrupted by the interior tunnels that open up in her mind. Woolf is brilliantly able to portray the interior time and the contrast between the interior time (subjective) and the exterior time (objective)
As Clarissa walks around London, her physical trajectory towards the flower shop is constantly interrupted by the interior tunnels that open up in her mind. She is thrown into the depths of the past and the uncertain terrain of the future. The dilated quality of her interior time is interrupted by the chimes of Big Ben. The chimes of Big Ben represents chronological time, which contrasts her interior time.

We are informed by Septimus’ illness as he hears the explosion of the tyre, as he hears the explosion of this tyre, he experiences a series of feelings, such as **alienation**, and since the rumor reminded him of the war, he totally **panics**: he was paralysed in the middle of the street.
He also feels **guilty** because he thinks that he is the one responsible for the traffic congestion.
As his wife tries to bring him back to reality, he became very **angry** to her, and then he feels **madness**, since he says that he will kill himself.

The **narrative technique** is characterised by **association**; the narrative is organised piece by piece through association; the point of view constantly shifts from one character to an other.
We are catapulted into the characters’ mind; in Virginia Woolf novel we still find the figure of a narrator that gives order to the characters thoughts (different from Joyce’s style).

The extract is rich in dashes, semicolons, questions marks, exclamations, very short sentences, that are meant to reproduce the working of the mind.

### T: *Clarissa’s party*

![Schermata 2021-05-30 alle 18.05.05](/assets/Schermata%202021-05-30%20alle%2018.05.05.png)
![Schermata 2021-05-30 alle 18.05.16](/assets/Schermata%202021-05-30%20alle%2018.05.16.png)

This is taken from the very end of the novel: all the guests have finally arrived to the party, but the festive atmosphere is ruined by the news of Septimus’ suicide.

Semptimus’ death is described through a series of expressions that emphasise the **brutality of the act**.

- **line 5**: His body was wounded by ‘the rusty spikes’ and smashed onto the ground
- **line 5**: *Up had flashed the ground*: inversion
- **line 5**: *blundering, bruising*: alliteration
- **line 6**: *a thud, thud, thud*: onomatopoeia and repetition
- **line 6**: *a suffocation of blackness*: metaphor

Mrs Dalloway mentally comments on the event: she is worried about the fact that death is now present in the middle of her party which was supposed to be a happy moment. Then she identifies with the young man and wonders why he has killed himself. Later on, she looks out of the window and sees an old woman staring at her from the window in the opposite room; the old woman is alone and she is going to bed. Then Clarissa hears her guests *laughing and shouting*; the clock *striking the hour* (**lines 51-4**). Mrs Dalloway is convinced that nevertheless the people at the party would go on living.  She understands that he payed to much attention to appearance and to social life.
Finally she resolves to come back to her guests.

At the very end of the novel, the difference between these two characters became very evidente.
We can connect Clarissa to an ideal of superficiality, whilee Septimus to inability to conform. An other opposition is sanity mental and illness. He is not able to overcome his pain and to find any meaning in his dramatic war experience and in fact he commit suicide.
She is the wife of a politician while Septimus rejects society: he is totally alineated for rejection of existence and final self acceptance.
She is ready to go on, after the moment of being she is a new person

## Feminism

Feminism is the belief in the social, economic, and political equality of sexes.
Historically women have been considered second class individue, and have been denied opportunity of furthering their studies, they were told that their home was the place where they belong to, and in different situation women have been subjected to men.

This movement developed in different waves:
- 1st wave of Feminism: late 19th century/early 20th century
- 2nd wave of Feminism: 1960s – 1980s
- 3rd wave of Feminism: mid 1990s
- 4th wave of Feminism: 2010s

### 1st wave of feminism

The first wave of feminism is focused on women struggle for the right to vote. Emmeline Parkhurst help women to organize themselves to get the right to vote. They started to protest in more violent ways, which challenged the ideal of domesticity.

The outbreak of WWI actually helped women in their process of emancipation . A lot of men were mobilised to go in role, and women replaced those men at work, and they proved as efficient as men. They were able to take new roles.
Also on the front line they proved fundamental as nurses.

Thanks to their role in the WWI they were able to break down all the remaining opposition to their cause.

In UK

- 1918: women over 30 gained the right to vote.
- 1928: suffrage to women over 21.

In USA

- 1919: The 19th amendment was added to the American constitution in 1919 and ratified in 1920.

### 2nd wave of feminism

It emerges in the 60s and it continued into the 80s. The difference with the first wave of feminism was that whether the first wave was totally focussed on legal rights, the second wave of feminism, that coincided with the **women’s lib movement**, touched every area of experience, politics, work, family, sexuality.

It started with the protests against the Miss America pageant in Atlantic City in 1968, since they thought that it was a cattle parade. They were against with the idea that reduced women to objects of beauty dominated by a patriarchy that sought to keep them in the home.

This second wave of feminism led women to reach many goals:
- greater access to education;
- more women in positions of leadership in different fields;
- women obtained more financial independence: in the past women didn’t own anything, since everything was of the male members of the family; in the 70s many laws were issued and women were finally recognise their financial independence;
- abortion rights, access to the contraceptive pills;
- many institution were founded, devouted to the protection and the promotion of women right: this is important, since in the past there weren’t organisations; 
- discourse about the importance of women’s right started to be on the popular level.

### 3rd wave of feminism

It emerges in the mid 1990s, because there was still some work to be done.
The peculiarity of this third way is that women rejected all the constructs that were developed in the past by the feminist of the first and the second wave.

Feminist of the third wave, refused to be identified as feminist, they rejected standardise objectivity.
They were against all those definition that had been provided in the past.

They found the word “feminist” limiting and exclusionary. They adopted a series of elements that were rejected in the past by the feminists of the first and second wave: lipstick, high heels, low cut necklines.
The idea they wanted to promote is that is possible to wear a push-up bra and a brain at the same time

In the past the use of lipstick was viewed as a form of male oppression.

### 4th wave of feminism

It emerges after 2010. The main feature is that feminists started to campaign on the web: it is strongly connected with the advent and the widespread of social media; they provided a new form of discussion, local stories can be spread worldwide.

Social media promote an idea of interconnection among women.

## Feminism and Virginia Woolf

Virginia Woolf contributed to the feminist cause since she denounced the role of subordination that women were subjected to. She was a veritable heroin to many feminists.
She was concerned to women’s position in literature.

In her diary she wrote that she was the only woman in England to say what she like: she wanted other women to freely express themselves.

She is in between the first and second wave of feminism. She took part in the campaigns of the first wave, but she is considered a forerunner of the second wave of feminism.

Her greatest contribution to feminism is represented by the essay *A room of one’s own*.
It was published in 1929, and it was based on two lectures that Virginia Woolf gave on university about women and fiction.

The style is peculiar and very innovative, since it actually seems a novel. The boundaries between criticism and fiction are extremely blurred in this essay.
This aspect is evidente since Woolf’s argument is made by a fictional character, Mary, which is the protagonist of this essay. She goes to the British museum, since she wants to know everything that has been said about women throughout history.

When she arrives at the British museum, she finds only books written by men: everything that had been said on women was said by men.
She understands that history and literature was male constructs, and she praises those few women who were able to became writers (Jane Austen, the Bronte Sisters) and than she analyses the causes for this minority of women writers.
The main reasons are related to socio-economic factors. They have been denied the opportunity to study, in the past women were often channeled in lowkey jobs, their role was to look after their children o their parents.
Because of this women’s creativity has been inhibited.

To really express themselves women need some privacy: a space where they can go and give bent to their emotions and thoughts. This space is represented by **a room of one’s own**.

### *A room of one’s own*
According to Virginia Woolf, women’s creativity has been inhibited by centuries of prejudices. To illustrate this point, she makes an example: she invents a story about Judith Shakespeare, a talented fictional sister of Shakespeare. Judith was as talented as her brother: she had the potential to became a famous writer, just like William, but she was denied the opportunities that William was offered. 

William went to school, he could study, whereas she wasn’t allowed to go to School. Virgil a Woolf recounts an episode in which Judith was even punished by her parents because they have found her with a book in her hands.
She was told that books were none of her business.

She wanted to became a writer, but her parents wanted her to marry a man that she didn’t actually love. She had been betrothed by her parents, and she was finally forced to commit suicide.

By illustrating this fictional story about Judith Shakespeare, Virginia Woolf was able to demonstrate the inequalities between women and men. Judith finally committed suicide because of the way society was structured against women.

Women need money and a **room of one’s own** to express themselves creativity. There is a mantra that is repeated in the essay: to be a writer a woman needs 40000 P a year, and then a room of one’s own, that is a space where women can be Women. They are no longer mothers or daughters, but only Women.

The image of the room actually implies an oxymoric connotation: on a first level, this room refers to a space where women can retreat and enjoy some privacy, away from her domestic duties; the real meaning of this metaphoric image refers to the possibility for women to invade spaces that historically were considered the spheres of men: it is not a place where to be confined, but it is an image for women to break confines and boundaries.
Women have to trespass trashows, to break the boundaries, so that women and men are finally really equal.

## *To the Lighthouse*

She published it in 1927, and the most important element of this novel is the treatment of time. The novel is divided into three sections:
- the window
- time passes
- the Lighthouse

**The first section** (which is the longest one) recounts the events of a single day. We find the **Ramsays**, that are a family, and they are spending their holidays in their summerhouse in the Hebrides (a group of islands near Scottland). One of the children wants to go to the Lighthouse, but because of bad wheather condition the trip has to be postponed.
It is the longest one because time is dilating because Virginia Woolf was mainly interested in the character's interior time.

The **second section** recounts with brevity the events that take place in a span of 10 years. We are informed that Ms Ramsay died, her eldest daughter also died, and one of the sons died as a victim of WWI, and this is an occasion to make a portrait of Britain in the world years, describing the athmospere of devastation boughts by the Great War.

The **third section** is based on the events of a single days. In the final section the family returns to the house in the Hebrides, Mr Ramsay finally goes to the Lighthouse with James, the child that 10 years earlier was so excited about this escursion. We find some guests that where present in the first section, such as Lily Briscoe, a painter; in the first section she started to make a portrait of Ms Ramsay and her children, and ten years later she finished the portrait.

The plot is not really relevant, the most important theme is the treatment of time, since Virginia Woolf delate and compress the time.

**Virginia Woolf symbolism**: the main symbol is the **lighthouse**, which is the alternation of light and darkness: this alternation is evident from the structure of the novel, which is A-B-A: the first section represents the long lightbeams of the lighthouse, then after this beams of light there is a pause of darkness, represented by the second section, the war years, and after this short pause we have again a flash of light, which is represented by the third section.
This alternation is also evidente in an episode that we find in the first section: Ms Ramsay has to tell her son James that they can't go to the Lighthouse. She starts thinking about the words that she can use to explain him that the trip had to be postponed. As she thinks about it she defines herself as a core of darkness, which represents her inner-self, which is different from her public self.

This novel is about the difficulty and the complexity of human relationship, because we are all thorned between our innerself and our publicself.

An other symbol is the **sea**, which is omnipresent, it is the background for every scene. The incessant movement of the waves represents the movement of Woolf's prose. Her prose was characterized by shifting different temporal places, the use of interior monologue.

# George Orwell

George Orwell was the pseudonym (*nom de plume*) of Eric Arthur Blair.
He published his first book after this pseudonym, becoming famous as George Orwell, and still today he is most widely known as Orwell.

He was born in 1903 in India, but he was educated in England. On living school he went to work as a superintendent in Burma, in Britain police force.
He soon realises that the British empire was based on a false and inequitable concept, so he developed socialist ideas, and he finally resigned. He decided to go back to Europe.

He developed a sense of guilt after his experience in Burma, and the idea that he had to make a process of expiation. He lived in Paris and in London, and disgusted with the snobbery and hypocrisy of the middle class (which he belonged to), and so he decided to carry out a social experiment: he decided to live the life of a poorer person, because he wanted to experience first hand poverty.

This experiment form the subject of his first book: *Down and Out in Paris and London* (1933). In this book he made a face to poverty.
Then he published *Burmese Days*, where he describes his experience in Britain police force in Burma, and then he published two novels in which he exposes his socialist views: *Clergyman’s Daughter* and *Keep the Aspidistra Flying*.

During the Spanish civil war, he worked as a reporter in Spain, and he also fought on the side of the Republicans against Franco, and this experience produces an other non narrative work: *Homage to Catalonia*.

The WWII broke out, and during it he wrote *Animal Farm* (1945), in which he criticise the Russian revolution, even thought he continued to hold socialist views. In this novel he satirise the Russian revolution, attacking the principles of Russian communism.

He published his masterpiece **_Nineteen Eighty-Four_** in 1949.

## *Animal Farm*
This is a political and allegorical fable.

There is a farm with some animals, but the animals, tired of being exploited by their human master, Mr Jones, decided to get rid of him, and they decided to set up a new community, ran by animals, based on egalitarian principle.
The animals make a rebellion, led by the pigs (that are the smartest animals in this fable): Napoleon and Snowball; critics find that these two pigs were an allegorical representation of Trotsky e Stalin. At a certain point Napoleon get rid of Snowball, starting ruling as a dictator, concentrating all the power in his hands. Basically the pigs restore a form of totalitarianism.

This fable ends with the pigs playing cards with men, and with the others animals looking at the pigs, who have became indistinguishable from men.
At the end of the fable pigs stand on their hind legs, which is remarkable since at the beginning their motto was “two legs bad, four legs good”, but by the end it became “four legs good, but two legs better”.

With this fable Orwell was able to show the process of corruption of the ideal of Russian Revolution, and he also demonstrated the tendency of create class stratification and class tyranny.

## *Nineteen Eighty-Four*
This is Orwell masterpiece. Written in 1948, and then he published it in 1949.
The story is settled in the future (1984), and in this future the world is divided into three main blocks: Oceania, Eurasia and Eustasia, superstates that control the whole word.

London is located in the superstate of Oceania, which corresponds to British empire and the americas. It is ruled by The Party, a small minority that controls every aspects of human life. Citizens are controlled through tele screens and microphone hidden everywhere, capturing everything.
The leader is Big Brother. Posters of him are put everywhere, with the caption ‘Big Brother is Watching you’.

The protagonist of the novel is Winston Smith. He works at the ministry of truth and his job consists in manipulating and revising historical facts, so that they fit with The Party’s official view of the past. 
The three superpowers are constantly at war, alliances changes: as the novel progresses we discover that this perpetual state of was is an illusion to keep people in a state of subordination and subjection.
As alliances change, the Party want to make history adhere to the current version of the past.

In the second part of the novel, Winston develops the idea of smashing the system. He has a illecit love affair with a Woman, Julia, which is also a dissenter: in this distopian society, sex is prohibited: sex can be conceived as an act of procreation, [in caso contrario] it is forbidden.
Julia and Winston have sex in a room which appears to have no telescreen, but in reality there is an hidden camera: they are discovered, arrested, and sent to Room 101, a space where people who committed illegal action were confronted with their worst fear.

In this room Winston is tortured, and brainwashed into conformity again. At the end of the novel we find Winston Smith living as an automaton, with is spirit finally broken.

### Themes

- **Critique of totalitarianism**: the value of 1984 lays in the detailed account that Orwell is able to provide about the political method of totalitarianism; he is able to describe what the methods of a totalitarian system are: how though is controlled, how privacy is invaded and how individuality is denied.
- **Use of mass media as agents of mass oppression**: in this novel the media have the function of brainwashing the population with paradoxical slogans; Orwlee shows how mass media can be used as means of political propaganda.
- **Censorship**: the Party controls the information that is delivered to its citizens, and the ministry of truth is actually concerned with the tramsission of untruth; the government edis what has been said about the present, the future and the past.
- **Sexual repression**: sex is prohibitted as a form of entertainment; sex is allowed only when it is conceveid as an act of procreation.
- **Subordination**: people have no freedom in this society.

Even though the novel is set in the future, Orwell only ecoing the horrors of nazism, fascism and communism.

### Language

Language plays a crucial role in this novel: the Party invented its own language, called "Newspeak": a langauge with limited vocabulary, because of troublesome words are removed and vanished (freedom, equality, etc...): they are dangerous, they might produce dangerous consequencies for the Party stability.

Newspeak is linked to **doublethink**: it is the act of holding simultanously two contraddictory ideas and believing in both idea simultanously and absolutely, with the same intensity, even if this two ideas are totally contraddictory.

### T: *Big Brother is watching you*

![Schermata 2021-05-30 alle 18.07.10](/assets/Schermata%202021-05-30%20alle%2018.07.10.png)![Schermata 2021-05-30 alle 18.07.19](/assets/Schermata%202021-05-30%20alle%2018.07.19.png)

The extract is taken from the beginning of the novel, and shows the city of London at it is seen by Winston Smith: London is located in Airstrip One, which is a province of Oceania, and the novel begins with this description of the city, which is in a state of desolation and decade.

We find Winston Smith who is going home after his workday, it is one o'clock, the sun is shining but even the sun is distopian: it is a **cold sun**; temperature is very cold, and there is an image of Winston who raises is shoulder up and lowers his chin not to feel the cold.

Winston Smith is 39 yo, he is physically weak, he is a smallish meager figure. He lives in a flat on the seventh floor, but he takes the stairs because the lift is out of order. Electricity is often catched of during the day, by the Party, in order to save money. He have to stop several times, since he is weak.

He is wearing the Party uniform, a pair of blue overalls. His memories have been erased, he annot remember anything about his own past. We are informed that he cannot remember when London started to be in this state of degradation, he can't even remember since when Oceania is in war.
Since past is always modified by the party, its impossible for citizens to had clear memory.

**Winston Smith** is a symbolic name: the name *Winston* reminds of Winston Churchill, while *Smith* is one of the most english surname: he stands for a man of the streets, he represents the whole humanity. He is a modern anti-hero.

He lives in a building which is in terrible condition, it always smells of boil cabbage and old rag mats. At the end of the hallway there is a poster with the image of Big Brother.
When he returns home, he ears a voice: every house has telescreens which can transmitt images and sounds but which can also capture images and sounds. This telescreens constantly trasmitt a voice which reproduce the Party ideals. These telescreens could not be swiched off, never, only volume can be regulated.

They couldn't know when they could be watched or overheard. There is no privacy neither freedom.

London is in a state of degradation: there is a general atmosphere of squalore, mismanagement (elettricity, lift); streets are covered with dust, the rooms of the buildings are covered with [willowherb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilobium): we have the idea of a city that is rotty. In the sky there are always elicopters controlling the citizens, and the city is colorless: the only colors are those of the posters of Big Brothers.

These posters contain the message "BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU", to remind citizens that they are always under sorvelliance.

The three slogan of the Party are:

- **War is peace**: by keeping the country on a state of war with the others superstates, the party is able to maintain the peace in its territory; war has to be seen positevly by citizens
- **Freedom is slavery**: this slogan is a sort of a subconscious discouragement, since the part want people not to desire freedom: people have to think that freedom is something negative;
- **Ignorance is strenght**: knowing too much is dangerous; the Party want its citizens to remain ignorant so they don't develop dangerous ideals.

There poster of slogans are interesting to analyze, since they remind of the power of advertisment in presente days. That's why this novel is so relevant today

### Link with civics: Freedom of the press

Orwell is a committed writer: he thought that is writing could be turned into a sort of politcal weapon, and so he believed that the language to be used had to be clear, simple and direct. He had leftist sympatis, but even though he thought that the writer had to maintain an independent view: he is not supposed to follow a party line.

In this novel we see how Orwell deals with the importance of a **free press**: in this novel there is no press freedom, since the Party controls any information which is delivered to its citizens, and we see how in so doing the party is able to get control on the present, the future and the past.

**Press freedom** refers to the ability of journalists to report freely on matters of public interest; press freedom is also derived of people to access informations. It belongs to every human being.
In order to make informed decision, people need to gather information: mass media are fondamental in this process.
Press freedom is a pillar of any functioning democracy. It is an indicator of a functioning democracy. 

This concept can be included into **freedom of expression**, that is afundamental human right, recognized in the *Universal declaration of Human Rights* (1948)

> Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and to seek, receive and impart information through any media and regardless of frontiers.

This article extabilish the importance of freedom of expression.

Freedom of the press is not a principle that is nationally included in the Constitutions of all democratic countries: Italy has an article in its constitution that mention the right of press freedom, while the UK have no contitutional garantee to press freedom.
Governments are very aware of the power of mass media, and they tend always to exert a form of control on mass media. Moreover non democratic countries have no right of free press.

United Nation instituted, on May the 3rd, the **World Press Freedom Day**, free press is not an optional right, but it is something that is important to protect.

# Aldous Huxley

He was born in Surrey in 1894, into a family of noted biologits and natural scientists.
He was physically weak in his eyes, and when he was young he became nearly blind, and so he wasn't able to follow a scientific career, but he succeeded into graduing in english in Oxford, deciding to became a writer.

His most famous novel is *Brave New World* (1932). During his life he published novels, essays and poems.
This novel is a mixture of distopian, science fiction and philosopical essay.

In the late 40s he moved to California, when he developed an interest into misticism and para-psychology.

He finally died in 1963, the same day that the american president Kennedy was assasinated, and so his death passed almost unnoticed.
It is as a novelist that he is mostly remembered, with his most succesful novel is *Brave new world*. There is doubt whether we can consider him a novelist in the real sense of the term: critics agree that Huxley is not novelist in the common sense of the word, they prefer to consider him a novelist of ideas.

**Novels of ideas** are novel based on a certain idea, so they revolve around the develpment of a certain point of view. 

## *Brave new world*

In *Brave new world* he develop the idea of the danger of **scientific progress**: he wanted to denounce the danger of the scientific progress. It is a science fiction novel in which Huxley portray an alarming picture of a future society: he describes a futuristic society in which technological and scientific progress have taken control over individual life.

*Brave new world* is a quotation from Shakespeare's play *The Tempest*: these words are pronounced by Miranda, the Daughter of Prospero. Since she was a child she lived alone, exiled on an island with her father: the first time she was other people she exclame: "Oh brave new world, that has such people in it".
Shakespeare is the greates english writer, he is the symbol of art, so probably with this title Huxley wanted to remind the reader about the fact that art is denied in the futuristic society he describes.

In this society technology and scientific progress had reach their utmost, everything is well structured and well organized, but people have lost their most authentic qualities, and they acts like puppets. 

The story is set in the seventh century AF (After Ford, the inventor of the modern factory system and of its essential organizational principle: the assembly line; he is regarded as a sort of deity in this story). Society is well structured, and it is based on stability, which is achieved through a specific cast classification system. It is a hierarchical society. 
- At the top we find the **alphas** and **betas**, they are the intellectual and the administrators, they are the most intelligent and the most physically perfect men and women.
- Below there are the **gammas**.
- At the bottom there are **deltas** and **epsilons**: they represents the manual workers, almost slaves. They accomplish the humbless tasks, and this is their role

People are born artificially, through artificial process: babies are produced and drawn in bottles, and even before they came into existance, they are brainwashed to conform to the cast they are predetermed to. They must be happy with their cast, they must like it and accept it. From the very beginning, even before being actually born, they are manipulated so that they are happy with their predetermined role.

The second key concept is **happiness**: everyone must be happy. Happiness is achieved through the consumption of a drug called **soma**, it is a sort of allucinogenon, that produces feelings of wellbeing, happiness, sexual promiscuity. Sex is seen as a form of mindless entertainment.

Art, literature, phylosophy are prohibitted in this society, since it might ruin the conditioning of every person.

The protagonist is **Bernard Marx**, an alpha-plus speciment, but he is dissatisfied with this antiseptic world, so one day he decides to visit a reservation in New Mexico. A reservation is a place, that is kept as the world was before scientific progress. Here he meets a savage, called John, and he decides to take John with him in London (which is the setting in place).

In London **John** is firstly fascinated by the world, but then he realises that it is not an happy world, so he rebels against its lack of freedom, passion, individuality, privacy, conformity.
He decides to live in an abandoned light house, he stats to lead a sort of Robinson Crusoe like existence, but he soon turnes into a sort of attraction to turists, and so he finally commits suicide: he understands that there is no possibility of being happy. There is no way out from this world.

### Themes

**Fordism**: with this reference of a mass production system that in this case is not applied to cars but to human beings: Henry Ford is a deity, who splits time; he is regarded as the most important person in the world, for his invenction of assembly line. Fordism replaced religion.

**Progress**, and in particular the effects of the scientific progress on the individual; tipically progress is regarded as something positive, but in this case Huxley emphasises the negative consequences related to an extreme belief in scientific progress.

**Technology**: Huxley wants to highlight the dangers of our worship for technology to the decadence of art, literature, phylosophy; technology is became the main value of the society.

**Totalitarianism**: this is a society characterized by an all-powerful state. It's similar to *1984* by Orwell. Orwell focused on a form of political totalitarianism, whil Huxley was more concerned with a technological totalitarianism.

### Features

It is characterized by a mixture of different literary genres: fable, science fiction, philosophical essay.

Its language varies from the clinically scientific to the satirical. Huxley's narrator often introduces veiled criticism of the world he is describing through particular comments or choice of a phrase.
The language varies in this novel. 

An other feature is that we can consider it a **prophetic book**: it is prophetic both in the long and in the short term.
On a short perspective, *Brave New World* anticipated the nazi policy of producing an arian master race, devoid of inferior individual. This arian master race was devoid of inferior individual.
In a long term, this novel anticipated contemporary biological manipulation. It anticipated the possibility of human cloning.

It is both an **utopian** and a **dystopian** novel. This society is a perfect society, where everything is perfectly organized, based on happiness. This happiness is possibile as long as no one questions the pillars on which this society is built, and that's why it is actually dystopian.

**Mental conditioning** is not invented by Huxley, but he took inspiration from the studies of a behavioural psychologists, Ivan Pavlov, who carried out experiments mainly on dogs; he wanted to condition the behaviour of dogs, through a system of punishment and rewards; he demonstrated how it is possible to condition someone's behaviour through this system.
Huxley showed how such research might be applied for dobious ends.

### T: *An unforgettable lesson*

> The nurses stiffened to attention as the D.H.C. came in.
> "Set out the books," he said curtly.
> In silence the nurses obeyed his command. Between the rose bowls the books were duly set out–a row of nursery quartos opened invitingly each at some gaily coloured image of beast or fish or bird.
> "Now bring in the children."
> They hurried out of the room and returned in a minute or two, each pushing a kind of tall dumb-waiter laden, on all its four wire-netted shelves, with eight-month-old babies, all exactly alike (a Bokanovsky Group, it was evident) and all (since their caste was Delta) dressed in khaki.
> "Put them down on the floor."
The infants were unloaded.
> "Now turn them so that they can see the flowers and books."
> Turned, the babies at once fell silent, then began to crawl towards those clusters of sleek colours, those shapes so gay and brilliant on the white pages. As they approached, the sun came out of a momentary eclipse behind a cloud. The roses flamed up as though with a sudden passion from within; a new and profound significance seemed to suffuse the shining pages of the books. From the ranks of the crawling babies came little squeals of excitement, gurgles and twitterings of pleasure.
> The Director rubbed his hands. "Excellent!" he said. "It might almost have been done on purpose."
> The swiftest crawlers were already at their goal. Small hands reached out uncertainly, touched, grasped, unpetaling the transfigured roses, crumpling the illuminated pages of the books. The Director waited until all were happily busy. Then, "Watch carefully," he said. And, lifting his hand, he gave the signal.
> The Head Nurse, who was standing by a switchboard at the other end of the room, pressed down a little lever.
> There was a violent explosion. Shriller and ever shriller, a siren shrieked. Alarm bells maddeningly sounded.
The children started, screamed; their faces were distorted with terror.
> "And now," the Director shouted (for the noise was deafening), "now we proceed to rub in the lesson with a mild electric shock."
> He waved his hand again, and the Head Nurse pressed a second lever. The screaming of the babies suddenly changed its tone. There was something desperate, almost insane, about the sharp spasmodic yelps to which they now gave utterance. Their little bodies twitched and stiffened; their limbs moved jerkily as if to the tug of unseen wires.
> "We can electrify that whole strip of floor," bawled the Director in explanation. "But that's enough," he signalled to the nurse.
> The explosions ceased, the bells stopped ringing, the shriek of the siren died down from tone to tone into silence. The stiffly twitching bodies relaxed, and what had become the sob and yelp of infant maniacs broadened out once more into a normal howl of ordinary terror.
> "Offer them the flowers and the books again."
> The nurses obeyed; but at the approach of the roses, at the mere sight of those gaily-coloured images of pussy and cock-a-doodle-doo and baa-baa black sheep, the infants shrank away in horror, the volume of their howling suddenly increased.
> "Observe," said the Director triumphantly, "observe."
> Books and loud noises, flowers and electric shocks–already in the infant mind these couples were compromisingly linked; and after two hundred repetitions of the same or a similar lesson would be wedded indissolubly. What man has joined, nature is powerless to put asunder.
> "They'll grow up with what the psychologists used to call an 'instinctive' hatred of books and flowers. Reflexes unalterably conditioned. They'll be safe from books and botany all their lives." The Director turned to his nurses. "Take them away again."
> Still yelling, the khaki babies were loaded on to their dumb-waiters and wheeled out, leaving behind them the smell of sour milk and a most welcome silence.
> One of the students held up his hand; and though he could see quite well why you couldn't have lower-cast people wasting the Community's time over books, and that there was always the risk of their reading something which might undesirably decondition one of their reflexes, yet … well, he couldn't understand about the flowers. Why go to the trouble of making it psychologically impossible for Deltas to like flowers?
> Patiently the D.H.C. explained. If the children were made to scream at the sight of a rose, that was on grounds of high economic policy. Not so very long ago (a century or thereabouts), Gammas, Deltas, even Epsilons, had been conditioned to like flowers–flowers in particular and wild nature in general. The idea was to make them want to be going out into the country at every available opportunity, and so compel them to consume transport.
> "And didn't they consume transport?" asked the student.
> "Quite a lot," the D.H.C. replied. "But nothing else."
> Primroses and landscapes, he pointed out, have one grave defect: they are gratuitous. A love of nature keeps no factories busy. It was decided to abolish the love of nature, at any rate among the lower classes; to abolish the love of nature, but not the tendency to consume transport. For of course it was essential that they should keep on going to the country, even though they hated it. The problem was to find an economically sounder reason for consuming transport than a mere affection for primroses and landscapes. It was duly found.
> "We condition the masses to hate the country," concluded the Director. "But simultaneously we condition them to love all country sports. At the same time, we see to it that all country sports shall entail the use of elaborate apparatus. So that they consume manufactured articles as well as transport. Hence those electric shocks."
> "I see," said the student, and was silent, lost in admiration.


The exstract is taken from the second chapter, and the setting is a scientific lab; there is the director of the center, and he is with some students, because he wants to show them the process of mental conditioning used with babies belonging to the lower casts.

The director tells the nurs to put the babies on the floor, where there are roses and books with bright images, that were meant to attract the babies. At the beginning they are free to crawl. 
At a certain point the director gives a signal, the nurse presses a lever, and then the room is filled with the sound of an explosion. The children receive mild elettic shocks. 
After this the children start screaming and crying, their bodies moves spasmodically.

They want these babies to develop a feeling of hatery towards nature and books-
If they loved nature, they probably want to be happy and spending their day in nature, but since they are supposed to work they have to hate nature.
If people read, they might develop dangerous thoughts that might decondition their reflexes.

Students are lost in admiration. No one questions the logic behind this experiment, because everyone is brainwashed from their birth

# Universal Declaration of Human Rights {ignore=true}

The **United Nations** is an international organization, designed to facilitate cohoperation in different fields, such as international laws, security, economic development, social progress, and human rights
This organization was founded after the end of WWWII, and it has an historical predecessor, the **league of nation**, which is internationally viewed as the forerunner of the United Nations.

After the WWII countries felt that a way had to be found to preserve the peace. In 1945 delegates from fifty nations gathered in San Francisco, determined to set up a new organization that would be really able to maintain the peace, and that would really help build a better world.
The main aim of the San Francisco conference was to produce a charter for a new organization that would be accetable to all countries. The process of writing this charter was monument, it took nearly months, from april to june. 
The most heated discussion regarded the right to vetal of the big five withing the security council. The UN is made up of different institution, and the security councile is one of the most important organs of this organization: it is made up of fifteen members: five are permanent, and the other ten members rotate. The five permanent (the big five) are United States, UK, France, China and Russia: they were the main powers after WWII, and for this reason they maintened that the role of preserving the peace fell most heavily on them.
The decision of the vetal right was taken with a qualified majority. Even thought this wasn't really democratic, it was still something to start with.

After the horrors of WWII all the nations were really motivated to find new strategies of cohoperation.

From the beginning to present days this organization has evolved: membership was left open to all peaceloving countries, and in fact today this organization is made up of 193 countries, almost the totality of the countries in the world.

This organization has evolved not only in terms of numbers of members, but also in terms of its fields of action. Among them we can include **Human Rights**, and the importance given by the UN to human rights is evidente from the founding charter, which was signed in San Francisco, and the from the **Universal Declaration of Human Rights**, which was signed in 1984 10th december.
This document is very important, because for the first time in history different nations worked together in this field to produce a common set of principles and rights. Basically all the nations didn't want history to repeat itself. They wanted to protect the whole world from future abuses like the ones that were carried out during WWII, in which millions of people were denied their basic rights, as human beings.

This declaration is made up of 30 articles

1. We are all born free and equal. We all have our own thoughts and ideas. We should all be treated in the same way.
1. These rights belong to everybody, whatever our differences.
1. We all have the right to life, and to live in freedom and safety.
1. Nobody has any right to make us a slave. We cannot make anyone else our slave.
1. Nobody has any right to hurt or torture us or treat us cruelly.
1. Everyone has the right to be protected by the law.
1. The law is the same for everyone. It must treat us all fairly.
1. We can all ask for the law to help us when we are not treated fairly.
1. Nobody has the right to put us in prison without a good reason, to keep us there or to send us away from our country.
1. If we are put on trial, this should be in public. The people who try us should not let anyone tell them what to do.
1. Nobody should be blamed for doing something until it has been proved. When people say we did a bad thing we have the right to show it is not true.
1. Nobody should try to harm our good name. Nobody has the right to come into our home, open our letters, or bother us, or our family, without a good reason.
1. We all have the right to go where we want to in our own country and to travel abroad as we wish.
1. If we are frightened of being badly treated in our own country, we all have the right to run away to another country to be safe.
1. We all have the right to belong to a country.
1. Every grown up has the right to marry and have a family if they want to. Men and women have the same rights when they are married, and when they are separated.
1. Everyone has the right to own things or share them. Nobody should take our things from us without a good reason.
1. We all have the right to believe in what we want to believe, to have a religion, or to change it if we wish.
1. We all have the right to make up our own minds, to think what we like, to say what we think, and to share our ideas with other people.
1. We all have the right to meet our friends and to work together in peace to defend our rights. Nobody can make us join a group if we don’t want to.
1. We all have the right to take part in the government of our country. Every grown up should be allowed to vote to choose their own leaders.
1. We all have the right to a home, enough money to live on and medical help if we are ill. Music, art, craft and sport are for everyone to enjoy.
1. Every grown up has the right to a job, to a fair wage for their work, and to join a trade union.
1. We all have the right to rest from work and to relax.
1. We all have the right to enough food, clothing, housing and health care. Mothers and children and people who are old, unemployed or disabled have the right to be cared for.
1. We all have the right to education, and to finish primary school, which should be free. We should be able to learn a career, or to make use of all our skills.
1. We all have the right to our own way of life, and to enjoy the good things that science and learning bring.
1. There must be proper order so we can all enjoy rights and freedoms in our own country and all over the world.
1. We have a duty to other people, and we should protect their rights and freedoms.
1. Nobody can take away these rights and freedoms from us.

The main **features** of these articles:

- human rights are universal and inalienable: they are universal since we are born with these rights, and every people posses these rights; they are inalienable since they cannot be taken away: you can't lose these rights
- they are indivisible: denial of one human rights inevitably empedes the enjoyment of others rigths: human rights are all equal in importance, they cannot be positioned in an hierarcical order.
- they are interdependent and interelated: together they contribute to a person's dignity, which cannot be reached if only one of these rigths is denied.

The UDHR has achieved the status of **customary international law**. The UDHR has achieved the status of **customary international law** [diritto internazionale consuetudinario]. This type of law refers to a series of legal implications that are legally binding even if there is not a written agreement.
In this case we do have a written document, but this declaration was issued by the general assembly of the UN, an organ of the UN: it is the most democratic organ in the UN, because all countries are represented in this council. The general assembly cannot issue resolutions that are legally binding.
In this case, this declaration has become legally binding for all the countries in the world. Some countries have actually incorporated in their consitution the principles codified by this declaration, but even when they don't have these principles explicitly mentioned in the national constitution, they are still expected to respect these principles.

# Samuel Bechet

He was a novelist, a playwright and a critic, but it is as a playwright that he is most widely known.

He was born in Dublin in 1906 from a middlle class family, and he studied modern literature, and he specialized in French and Italian. After his studies at university he went to Paris to work as a lecturer of english. He travelled through Germany, French, Ireland, England, and then he finally settled in France. 

He published his early novels in english, but then he turned to french, and it is in French that he first published his masterpieces: *En attendant Godot* (1952, published in english in 1955 as *Waiting for Godot*) and *Fin de Partie* (1957, published in english in 1958 as *End Game*). He became famous for the first play. 
He first published these plays in France and then he translated it in english.

In 1969 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literatura, and he finally died in 1989.

Some critics consider Beckett as the last modernist. He is somewhere in between modernism and present age.

## The theatre of the absurd

He is considered the main representative of the **theatre of the absurd**. With this expression we refer to a group of dramatist who wrote between the 1950s and 1960s, and the main feature of these dramatist is that they gave expression to feelings of loss, meaninglessness, confusion; they gave expression to that sense of nullity and absurdity.

The atomic bomb on Iroshima and Nagasaki, as well as the nazi death-camps had shocked the whole world, to the point that a german theorist, Adorno, said that art was no longer possible after Aushwitz.
Samuel Beckett answered with his literary production and with his theatre of absurd, challenging Adorndo point of view.

Samuel Beckett is considered the main representative of the theatre of the absurd, with his plays he confronted men with this absence of meanings, which emerges after WWII.
He presented man trapped in everyday living, with the need of finding meanings and purposes from the past which however are no longer valid for the present. He portrayed this sense of nullity, this idea of non existance, of meaninglessness, and he express this nostalgia for past meanings which were no longer usefull after what had happened.

## *Waiting fot Godot*

This play is subtitled "a tragicomedy in two acts".
This play has both comic and tragic elements, there are some ironic connotation, as well as some terrifing implication. It is divided into two acts, but both are very similar, because there is no real plot. What happens in the first act, happens also in the second one, with some differences.

The first words of this play are "nothing to be done", and in fact it happens nothing in this play.
We find two characters, **Vladimir** and **Estragon**, they two tramps, they stand by a tree in a road, and they talk with each other while they wait for a misterious figure, Mr. Godot. They fill time with their meaningless discussion, they play absurd wordgames.
While they are waiting two others characters appear, Pozzo and Lucky.
At the end of the first act, an unnamed boy appears on stage, saying that Godot's arrival is postponed, because he will arrive the next day.
Thi is exactly what happened also in the second act, with the difference that Pozzo and this unnamed boy do not remember about the previous day.

In this play there is no action, it's the situation that take precedence over action. Samuel Beckett wanted to show the absence of purposes and meaning in life.
The structure is almost simmetrical, circular because there is no beginning and there is no end. The audience had the impression that this repetition will continue to go on endlessly.

In this play we find five characters: Vladimr and Estragon, Pozzo and Lucky and this unnamed boy. Four of these five character can be grouped in complementary couples:

- Vladimir and Estragon are mutually dependend, one cannot exist without the other; they do not have the same personality, they are complementary: Vladimir is the most practical, rational and intellectual, whereas Estragon is more childish, and he tends to fall asleep and to dream, while Vladimir is speaking: they are mutually dependent.
- Lucky and Pozzo: Pozzo is the master, and Lucky is the slave: When they appear on stage, Pozzo is drawing Lucky with a rope, so they are mutually dependend in the same way Vladimir and Estragon are. 

Pozzo cannot remember anything about the previous day, whereas Lucky can, and so we can make an other distinction among these characters:

- Vladimir and Lucky, as they stand for the intellect
- Estragon and Pozzo, as they stand for the body

In this play Beckett was also able to show the duality between mind and body.

We don't know much about the unnamed boy and about the others characters: in this play there is little plot and also little charactarization.

There is also Godot, who never appears: the tramps perceive that Godot might give meaning to their life, but they also fear him.
Critics have discussed about the real identity of Godot: Beckett said that not even him knew who Godot was. Critics said that Godot might represents God. 

Actually this play ends with the words
> Let's Go.

Even if we don't see Godot in stage, ironically in the end of the stage it appears, since "go." is the same as "go dot". 
Godot can also be paralled with the idea of ending, if he had appeared on the stage the play would have found its end, but this play is centered on repetition.

In spite of the reiterated theme of nonexistance, the characters actually go on existing; it seems that they are trapped on stage, they would like to leave the stage but they are compelled to stay.
They are compelled to stay because of the existance of the play itself, which is to be performed. 

For Becket not only life and society are absurd, but we also see how art becomes part of the tirany of existance: art like life is an act of creation and continuance, but art can no longer provide us with meanings capable of filling our interior void; art is no longer capable of providing us a solution for our sense of misery.
His position is different from that of Joyce and Eliot, who saw art as a pseudo-religion form of salvation.

### Themes

The most important theme is the **theme of waiting**: all the play revolves around this continuosly postponed meeting with mister Godot: this is the first theme: the individual trapped in a constant process of waiting.

**Inability to act** through the representation of action without progression: there is no action, no progression, its the situation that rules the play.

**Incomunicability** between human beings: Vladimir and Estragon go on talking, but they talk about nothing: they aren't really communicating.

**Sterility of the world**: this is evident from the sterile connotation of their dialogues, but also this is an aspect that we can infer from the absence of women and also from the setting, which is minimalistic (there is only a solitary tree)

**Characters' lack of memory**

The setting is always the same, these two tramps stand by the side of a road, next to this solitary tree, the setting is minimalistic as the plot is, but there is no real sense of place: it could be any road or any tree.

An unnamed boy appears, bringing the news that Mr. Godot won't come that evening, maybe he will come the following name; this boy delivers the message to Vladimir; Estragon is actually sleeping.
Some traits emerges and distinguish them, even though there is little characterization.

They decided not to go anywhere, and they decided to stay there in order to keep on waiting for Godot arrival. They consider the possibility of commiting suicide, but they abandon this idea since they do not have the physical instruments to kill themselves, they consider the possibility of using Estragon belt, which is too short and not strong enough.
There is an other reason that prevent them to taking their life again: death would signify a permanent separation between the two: they are mutually dependent, and they cannot part, they cannot separate: they both know that each one depends on the other, because it is the other that gives the sense that they exist. So there is a relationship of interdependence and also of affection apparently.

But this affection is only apparent: they keep talking to each other, but we have the idea that they are both immersed in their own universe, and they do not really try to communicate in what their universe consists

The language is simple, quit informal and essential. The dialogue is made up of a lot of ready made phrases, and it also made up of a lot of silences and pauses, which are meant to interupt the flow of conversation. There are a lot of repetition which are meant to reproduce the repetitiveness of life.
Words often have a double sense, a comic sense and a tragic sense. There is a peculiarity: this play is not only characterized by the combination of comic elements on the one hand and tragic elements on the other hand: this play is characterized by events and words that have both comic and tragic meaning simultanuosly.

The final message that we find in this play is that nothing can be done by contemporary men except for waiting. Becket is trying to make the audience feel and share this process of waiting, and then he want to make the audience experience the quality of inaction.

## Different types of theatre

It evidente that **Becket** moved away from the traditional features of drama.

**Oscar Wilde**'s plots are based on the idea of social climbing, while in **Shaw**'s plots there is always a social theme (the theatre was conceived as a tool to improve society). In **Becket** there is no plot.

**Wilde**'s setting is London High Society; **Shaw** uses London as a setting of his plays, but not only the upper classes; in **Becket** the setting is minimalistic and symbolic

The characters are outsiders for **Becket**, while in **Shaw** characters are mouthpeaces of the playwrights idea: he wanted to bring social issues to light, in order to improve society. In **Wilde** the characters are [stereotipati], since they are meant to entertain and satirize about the Victorian society.

**Wilde**'s aim was to entertain and satirize about the Victorian society without letting the audience thinking, **Shaw**'s aim was to improve society, he uses is theatre as a weapon and so he wasn't really appreciated since he attacked to harsh the society. **Beckett**'s aim was to highlight the lack of communication and the absence of meaning and purposes of contemporary society.
