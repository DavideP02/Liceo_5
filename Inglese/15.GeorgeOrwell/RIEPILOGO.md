George Orwell was the pseudonym (*nom de plume*) of Eric Arthur Blair.
He published his first book after this pseudonym, becoming famous as George Orwell, and still today he is most widely known as Orwell.

He was born in 1903 in India, but he was educated in England. On living school he went to work as a superintendent in Burma, in Britain police force.
He soon realises that the British empire was based on a false and inequitable concept, so he developed socialist ideas, and he finally resigned. He decided to go back to Europe.

He developed a sense of guilt after his experience in Burma, and the idea that he had to make a process of expiation. He lived in Paris and in London, and disgusted with the snobbery and hypocrisy of the middle class (which he belonged to), and so he decided to carry out a social experiment: he decided to live the life of a poorer person, because he wanted to experience first hand poverty.

This experiment form the subject of his first book: *Down and Out in Paris and London* (1933). In this book he made a face to poverty.
Then he published *Burmese Days*, where he describes his experience in Britain police force in Burma, and then he published two novels in which he exposes his socialist views: *Clergyman’s Daughter* and *Keep the Aspidistra Flying*.

During the Spanish civil war, he worked as a reporter in Spain, and he also fought on the side of the Republicans against Franco, and this experience produces an other non narrative work: *Homage to Catalonia*.

The WWII broke out, and during it he wrote *Animal Farm* (1945), in which he criticise the Russian revolution, even thought he continued to hold socialist views. In this novel he satirise the Russian revolution, attacking the principles of Russian communism.

He published his masterpiece **_Nineteen Eighty-Four_** in 1949.

## *Animal Farm*
This is a political and allegorical fable.

There is a farm with some animals, but the animals, tired of being exploited by their human master, Mr Jones, decided to get rid of him, and they decided to set up a new community, ran by animals, based on egalitarian principle.
The animals make a rebellion, led by the pigs (that are the smartest animals in this fable): Napoleon and Snowball; critics find that these two pigs were an allegorical representation of Trotsky e Stalin. At a certain point Napoleon get rid of Snowball, starting ruling as a dictator, concentrating all the power in his hands. Basically the pigs restore a form of totalitarianism.

This fable ends with the pigs playing cards with men, and with the others animals looking at the pigs, who have became indistinguishable from men.
At the end of the fable pigs stand on their hind legs, which is remarkable since at the beginning their motto was “two legs bad, four legs good”, but by the end it became “four legs good, but two legs better”.

With this fable Orwell was able to show the process of corruption of the ideal of Russian Revolution, and he also demonstrated the tendency of create class stratification and class tyranny.

## *Nineteen Eighty-Four*
This is Orwell masterpiece. Written in 1948, and then he published it in 1949.
The story is settled in the future (1984), and in this future the world is divided into three main blocks: Oceania, Eurasia and Eustasia, superstates that control the whole word.

London is located in the superstate of Oceania, which corresponds to British empire and the americas. It is ruled by The Party, a small minority that controls every aspects of human life. Citizens are controlled through tele screens and microphone hidden everywhere, capturing everything.
The leader is Big Brother. Posters of him are put everywhere, with the caption ‘Big Brother is Watching you’.

The protagonist of the novel is Winston Smith. He works at the ministry of truth and his job consists in manipulating and revising historical facts, so that they fit with The Party’s official view of the past. 
The three superpowers are constantly at war, alliances changes: as the novel progresses we discover that this perpetual state of was is an illusion to keep people in a state of subordination and subjection.
As alliances change, the Party want to make history adhere to the current version of the past.

In the second part of the novel, Winston develops the idea of smashing the system. He has a illecit love affair with a Woman, Julia, which is also a dissenter: in this distopian society, sex is prohibited: sex can be conceived as an act of procreation, [in caso contrario] it is forbidden.
Julia and Winston have sex in a room which appears to have no telescreen, but in reality there is an hidden camera: they are discovered, arrested, and sent to Room 101, a space where people who committed illegal action were confronted with their worst fear.

In this room Winston is tortured, and brainwashed into conformity again. At the end of the novel we find Winston Smith living as an automaton, with is spirit finally broken.

### Themes

- **Critique of totalitarianism**: the value of 1984 lays in the detailed account that Orwell is able to provide about the political method of totalitarianism; he is able to describe what the methods of a totalitarian system are: how though is controlled, how privacy is invaded and how individuality is denied.
- **Use of mass media as agents of mass oppression**: in this novel the media have the function of brainwashing the population with paradoxical slogans; Orwlee shows how mass media can be used as means of political propaganda.
- **Censorship**: the Party controls the information that is delivered to its citizens, and the ministry of truth is actually concerned with the tramsission of untruth; the government edis what has been said about the present, the future and the past.
- **Sexual repression**: sex is prohibitted as a form of entertainment; sex is allowed only when it is conceveid as an act of procreation.
- **Subordination**: people have no freedom in this society.

Even though the novel is set in the future, Orwell only ecoing the horrors of nazism, fascism and communism.

### Language

Language plays a crucial role in this novel: the Party invented its own language, called "Newspeak": a langauge with limited vocabulary, because of troublesome words are removed and vanished (freedom, equality, etc...): they are dangerous, they might produce dangerous consequencies for the Party stability.

Newspeak is linked to **doublethink**: it is the act of holding simultanously two contraddictory ideas and believing in both idea simultanously and absolutely, with the same intensity, even if this two ideas are totally contraddictory.

### T: *Big Brother is watching you*

The extract is taken from the beginning of the novel, and shows the city of London at it is seen by Winston Smith: London is located in Airstrip One, which is a province of Oceania, and the novel begins with this description of the city, which is in a state of desolation and decade.

We find Winston Smith who is going home after his workday, it is one o'clock, the sun is shining but even the sun is distopian: it is a **cold sun**; temperature is very cold, and there is an image of Winston who raises is shoulder up and lowers his chin not to feel the cold.

Winston Smith is 39 yo, he is physically weak, he is a smallish meager figure. He lives in a flat on the seventh floor, but he takes the stairs because the lift is out of order. Electricity is often catched of during the day, by the Party, in order to save money. He have to stop several times, since he is weak.

He is wearing the Party uniform, a pair of blue overalls. His memories have been erased, he annot remember anything about his own past. We are informed that he cannot remember when London started to be in this state of degradation, he can't even remember since when Oceania is in war.
Since past is always modified by the party, its impossible for citizens to had clear memory.

**Winston Smith** is a symbolic name: the name *Winston* reminds of Winston Churchill, while *Smith* is one of the most english surname: he stands for a man of the streets, he represents the whole humanity. He is a modern anti-hero.

He lives in a building which is in terrible condition, it always smells of boil cabbage and old rag mats. At the end of the hallway there is a poster with the image of Big Brother.
When he returns home, he ears a voice: every house has telescreens which can transmitt images and sounds but which can also capture images and sounds. This telescreens constantly trasmitt a voice which reproduce the Party ideals. These telescreens could not be swiched off, never, only volume can be regulated.

They couldn't know when they could be watched or overheard. There is no privacy neither freedom.

London is in a state of degradation: there is a general atmosphere of squalore, mismanagement (elettricity, lift); streets are covered with dust, the rooms of the buildings are covered with [willowherb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilobium): we have the idea of a city that is rotty. In the sky there are always elicopters controlling the citizens, and the city is colorless: the only colors are those of the posters of Big Brothers.

These posters contain the message "BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU", to remind citizens that they are always under sorvelliance.

The three slogan of the Party are:

- **War is peace**: by keeping the country on a state of war with the others superstates, the party is able to maintain the peace in its territory; war has to be seen positevly by citizens
- **Freedom is slavery**: this slogan is a sort of a subconscious discouragement, since the part want people not to desire freedom: people have to think that freedom is something negative;
- **Ignorance is strenght**: knowing too much is dangerous; the Party want its citizens to remain ignorant so they don't develop dangerous ideals.

There poster of slogans are interesting to analyze, since they remind of the power of advertisment in presente days. That's why this novel is so relevant today

### Link with civics: Freedom of the press

Orwell is a committed writer: he thought that is writing could be turned into a sort of politcal weapon, and so he believed that the language to be used had to be clear, simple and direct. He had leftist sympatis, but even though he thought that the writer had to maintain an independent view: he is not supposed to follow a party line.

In this novel we see how Orwell deals with the importance of a **free press**: in this novel there is no press freedom, since the Party controls any information which is delivered to its citizens, and we see how in so doing the party is able to get control on the present, the future and the past.

**Press freedom** refers to the ability of journalists to report freely on matters of public interest; press freedom is also derived of people to access informations. It belongs to every human being.
In order to make informed decision, people need to gather information: mass media are fondamental in this process.
Press freedom is a pillar of any functioning democracy. It is an indicator of a functioning democracy. 

This concept can be included into **freedom of expression**, that is afundamental human right, recognized in the *Universal declaration of Human Rights* (1948)

> Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and to seek, receive and impart information through any media and regardless of frontiers.

This article extabilish the importance of freedom of expression.

Freedom of the press is not a principle that is nationally included in the Constitutions of all democratic countries: Italy has an article in its constitution that mention the right of press freedom, while the UK have no contitutional garantee to press freedom.
Governments are very aware of the power of mass media, and they tend always to exert a form of control on mass media. Moreover non democratic countries have no right of free press.

United Nation instituted, on May the 3rd, the **World Press Freedom Day**, free press is not an optional right, but it is something that is important to protect.
