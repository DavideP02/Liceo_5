# 6 mag 2021 - George Orwell
- ==p. 274==

George Orwell was the pseudonym (*nom de plume*) of Eric Arthur Blair.
He published his first book after this pseudonym, becoming famous as George Orwell, and still today he is most widely known as Orwell.

He was born in 1903 in India, but he was educated in England. On living school he went to work as a superintendent in Burma, in Britain police force.
He soon realises that the British empire was based on a false and inequitable concept, so he developed socialist ideas, and he finally resigned. He decided to go back to Europe.

He developed a sense of guilt after his experience in Burma, and the idea that he had to make a process of expiation. He lived in Paris and in London, and disgusted with the snobbery and hypocrisy of the middle class (which he belonged to), and so he decided to carry out a social experiment: he decided to live the life of a poorer person, because he wanted to experience first hand poverty.

This experiment form the subject of his first book: *Down and Out in Paris and London* (1933). In this book he made a face to poverty.
Then he published *Burmese Days*, where he describes his experience in Britain police force in Burma, and then he published two novels in which he exposes his socialist views: *Clergyman’s Daughter* and *Keep the Aspidistra Flying*.

During the Spanish civil war, he worked as a reporter in Spain, and he also fought on the side of the Republicans against Franco, and this experience produces an other non narrative work: *Homage to Catalonia*.

The WWII broke out, and during it he wrote *Animal Farm* (1945), in which he criticise the Russian revolution, even thought he continued to hold socialist views. In this novel he satirise the Russian revolution, attacking the principles of Russian communism.

He published his masterpiece **_Nineteen Eighty-Four_** in 1949.

## *Animal Farm*
This is a political and allegorical fable.

There is a farm with some animals, but the animals, tired of being exploited by their human master, Mr Jones, decided to get rid of him, and they decided to set up a new community, ran by animals, based on egalitarian principle.
The animals make a rebellion, led by the pigs (that are the smartest animals in this fable): Napoleon and Snowball; critics find that these two pigs were an allegorical representation of Trotsky e Stalin. At a certain point Napoleon get rid of Snowball, starting ruling as a dictator, concentrating all the power in his hands. Basically the pigs restore a form of totalitarianism.

This fable ends with the pigs playing cards with men, and with the others animals looking at the pigs, who have became indistinguishable from men.
At the end of the fable pigs stand on their hind legs, which is remarkable since at the beginning their motto was “two legs bad, four legs good”, but by the end it became “four legs good, but two legs better”.

With this fable Orwell was able to show the process of corruption of the ideal of Russian Revolution, and he also demonstrated the tendency of create class stratification and class tyranny.

## *Nineteen Eighty-Four*
This is Orwell masterpiece. Written in 1948, and then he published it in 1949.
The story is settled in the future (1984), and in this future the world is divided into three main blocks: Oceania, Eurasia and Eustasia, superstates that control the whole word.

London is located in the superstate of Oceania, which corresponds to British empire and the americas. It is ruled by The Party, a small minority that controls every aspects of human life. Citizens are controlled through tele screens and microphone hidden everywhere, capturing everything.
The leader is Big Brother. Posters of him are put everywhere, with the caption ‘Big Brother is Watching you’.

The protagonist of the novel is Winston Smith. He works at the ministry of truth and his job consists in manipulating and revising historical facts, so that they fit with The Party’s official view of the past. 
The three superpowers are constantly at war, alliances changes: as the novel progresses we discover that this perpetual state of was is an illusion to keep people in a state of subordination and subjection.
As alliances change, the Party want to make history adhere to the current version of the past.

In the second part of the novel, Winston develops the idea of smashing the system. He has a illecit love affair with a Woman, Julia, which is also a dissenter: in this distopian society, sex is prohibited: sex can be conceived as an act of procreation, [in caso contrario] it is forbidden.
Julia and Winston have sex in a room which appears to have no telescreen, but in reality there is an hidden camera: they are discovered, arrested, and sent to Room 101, a space where people who committed illegal action were confronted with their worst fear.

In this room Winston is tortured, and brainwashed into conformity again. At the end of the novel we find Winston Smith living as an automaton, with is spirit finally broken.
