# 13 mag 2021 - Universal declaration of human rights

The **United Nations** is an international organization, designed to facilitate cohoperation in different fields, such as international laws, security, economic development, social progress, and human rights
This organization was founded after the end of WWWII, and it has an historical predecessor, the **league of nation**, which is internationally viewed as the forerunner of the United Nations.

After the WWII countries felt that a way had to be found to preserve the peace. In 1945 delegates from fifty nations gathered in San Francisco, determined to set up a new organization that would be really able to maintain the peace, and that would really help build a better world.
The main aim of the San Francisco conference was to produce a charter for a new organization that would be accetable to all countries. The process of writing this charter was monument, it took nearly months, from april to june. 
The most heated discussion regarded the right to vetal of the big five withing the security council. The UN is made up of different institution, and the security councile is one of the most important organs of this organization: it is made up of fifteen members: five are permanent, and the other ten members rotate. The five permanent (the big five) are United States, UK, France, China and Russia: they were the main powers after WWII, and for this reason they maintened that the role of preserving the peace fell most heavily on them.
The decision of the vetal right was taken with a qualified majority. Even thought this wasn't really democratic, it was still something to start with.

After the horrors of WWII all the nations were really motivated to find new strategies of cohoperation.

From the beginning to present days this organization has evolved: membership was left open to all peaceloving countries, and in fact today this organization is made up of 193 countries, almost the totality of the countries in the world.

This organization has evolved not only in terms of numbers of members, but also in terms of its fields of action. Among them we can include **Human Rights**, and the importance given by the UN to human rights is evidente from the founding charter, which was signed in San Francisco, and the from the **Universal Declaration of Human Rights**, which was signed in 1984 10th december.
This document is very important, because for the first time in history different nations worked together in this field to produce a common set of principles and rights. Basically all the nations didn't want history to repeat itself. They wanted to protect the whole world from future abuses like the ones that were carried out during WWII, in which millions of people were denied their basic rights, as human beings.

This declaration is made up of 30 articles
- MANCA articoli da slide

The main **features** of these articles:
- human rights are universal and inalienable: they are universal since we are born with these rights, and every people posses these rights; they are inalienable since they cannot be taken away: you can't lose these rights
- they are indivisible: denial of one human rights inevitably empedes the enjoyment of others rigths: human rights are all equal in importance, they cannot be positioned in an hierarcical order.
- they are interdependent and interelated: together they contribute to a person's dignity, which cannot be reached if only one of these rigths is denied.

The UDHR has achieved the status of **customary international law**
