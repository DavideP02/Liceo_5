# 14 mag 2021 - UDHR

The UDHR has achieved the status of **customary international law** [diritto internazionale consuetudinario]. This type of law refers to a series of legal implications that are legally binding even if there is not a written agreement.
In this case we do have a written document, but this declaration was issued by the general assembly of the UN, an organ of the UN: it is the most democratic organ in the UN, because all countries are represented in this council. The general assembly cannot issue resolutions that are legally binding.
In this case, this declaration has become legally binding for all the countries in the world. Some countries have actually incorporated in their consitution the principles codified by this declaration, but even when they don't have these principles explicitly mentioned in the national constitution, they are still expected to respect these principles.
