#### The theory of the unconscious

Freud is undoubtedly best known for his studies about the unconscious mind and its fundamental role in the understanding of conscious thought and behaviour. For Freud, dreams were an insight into our innermost thoughts and he called them the 'royal road to the unconscious because they were a means of revealing the workings of the unconscious mind. He developed his first theory of the psyche in _The Interpretation of Dreams_ (1900), in which he stated that the unconscious is where dreams and all the automatic thoughts that arise spontaneously without a recognisable cause are formed. The unconscious is where the forgotten memories lie in a dormant state and they may become accessible to the conscious mind at a later time. It is also the container of implicit knowledge that has been passed down from generation to generation.

#### Id, ego and superego

Freud believed that our personality develops through interaction between the three main parts of the human mind: the id, ego and superego

The id is the most primitive. Within the id are all the inherited components of personality we are born with, including the sex instinct, the Eros and the instinct towards aggression. The id operates entirely unconsciously; it does not change with time or experience, since it is not related to the external world.

The ego is the rational, pragmatic part of our personality. It is less primitive than the id and is both conscious and unconscious; it represents what may be called reason and common sense. Freud used the word ego' to mean a set of psychic functions such as judgement, tolerance, reality testing, control, planning, defence, synthesis of information, intellectual functioning and memory

The superego is concerned with social rules and morals, and covers what many would refer to as conscience. It develops around the age of 3-5 and it consists of two systems, the conscience and the ideal self. The conscience is a part that can punish the ego by making it feel guilty. The ideal self, on the other hand, creates an imaginary picture of how you ought to be, and deals with ambition and social behaviour, including how to treat others and how to be a useful member of society.

According to Freud, the id, ego and superego are in constant conflict so that adult personality and behaviour are derived directly from the results of these internal childhood struggles.

#### The Oedipus complex

Freud believed that a common source of psychic conflict derived from sexual fantasies in childhood and this theory seemed obscene to the respectable public at that time. The most famous example of conflict is the Oedipus complex, which is probably the most controversial of all his theories of relationships. In 1909 Freud wrote a paper, _Analysis of a Phobia in a Five-Year-Old Boy_, in which he outlined the fear of horses of a boy known as 'Little Hans'. Freud believed that the boy's terror was due to feelings of anger related to his parents he had internalised. According to Freud, all small boys choose their mother as their primary object of desire. They subconsciously wish to usurp their father and become their mother's lover. These desires appear between the ages of 3 and 5. when a boy is in what Freud defined as the phallic stage of development. This stage represents an important point in the formation of sexual identity. The analogous experience for girls is known as the Electra complex, in which girls feel desire for their father and jealousy of their mother. The child, however, suspects that acting on these feelings would lead to danger, thus he/she represses his/her desires. This leads to anxiety. In order to resolve the conflict. the boy then identifies with his father and the girl with her mother. It is at this point that the superego is formed; it becomes an internalisation of the parental figure that strives to suppress the id's impulses and make the ego act upon these idealistic standards.

#### Adler and Jung

Although Freud's second masterpiece _Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality_ (1905) further alienated him from contemporary psychiatry, he soon found loyal disciples. They founded the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society in 1908. However, some of them moved away from their master; the two best known were Alfred Adler (1870-1937) and Carl Gustav Jung 6.3]. Adler highlighted the importance of the aggression with which those people who lack some quality they desire express their discontent. Inferiority complex, a much abused term, is Adlerian.
