# Age of Anxiety & Modernism

## The crisis of certainties

The First World War left Britain in a disillusioned and cynical mood: some soldiers celebrated their return home with a frantic search for pleasure; others were haunted by a sense of guilt for the horrors of trench warfare, or missed the sense of purpose the war years had given them. The gap between the generation of the young and the older one, regarded as responsible for the terrible waste of lives during the war, grew wider and wider. An increasing feeling of rootlessness and frustration, due to the slow dissolution of the Empire into the Commonwealth, led to a transformation of the notions of imperial hegemony and white superiority.
Writers like Edward Morgan Forster became averse to political subjection and thought in terms of personal relationships based on equality and feeling. The committed writers of the 1930s and 1940s like Wystan Hugh Auden and George Orwell warned their readers against totalitarianism.
Nothing seemed to be right or certain: scientists and philosophers destroyed the old, predictable universe which had sustained the Victorians in their optimistic outlook, and new views of man and the universe that had emerged at the beginning of the century spread through society.

## Influences of Modernism

* Technological innovation in 20th century:
  * introduction of electricity, which had a huge impact on life
  * improvement in mass transport
  * advent of the Radio, Cinema: thank to the radio people could reach informations more easily, and this produce a feeling of cohesion
  * the governments were aware of the power of this mass communication mean: it was an easier and wider propaganda

### Freud

He is an Austrian psychologist, founder of the psychoanalysis. He published the _Interpretation of dreams_ in 1900: in this essay he analyses the unconscious. There are 2 components in our mind, and the unconscious is the most important one. There is something inside us that pushes us to do or not to do something: this hidden force operate somehow in an unconscious way. His theory was quite disturbing at that time because he stated that we are in some way non controlled. The discovery that man's actions could be motivated by irrational forces of which he might know nothing is very disturbing.

Human mind is formed by the **ID**, the **EGO** and the **SUPEREGO**.
1. The **id** is the most instinctual part and the most primitive; it's where we have our impulses, such as sex instinct, eros, aggressivity; it doesn't change with time, and it is not related to the external world.
2. The **ego** is the part of our mind related to rationality.
3. The **superego** is subdivided in 2 components: the **moral conscience**, which has the role to feel us guilty; the role of the **ideaself** is to show us how we should behave.

The ego has a mediation role between the impulses and our morality. According to him the unconscious is the post important part and dreams are the only way to enter the unconscious. Dreams are the key to access and to analyze our mind, and in particular the unconscious component of our mind.

He used a method called **free association of ideas** in order to investigate our mind, and this concept strongly influenced the modern age.

His theory also placed enormous importance on the demands of the 'libido', particularly those manifested in Oedipus phase.
The Freudian concept of infantile sexuality focused attention on the importance of early development, and childhood regained a status it had only in the pages of Rousseau.

For Modernism, Interpretation of dreams to understand our behaviour

##### The theory of the unconscious

Freud is undoubtedly best known for his studies about the unconscious mind and its fundamental role in the understanding of conscious thought and behaviour. For Freud, dreams were an insight into our innermost thoughts and he called them the 'royal road to the unconscious because they were a means of revealing the workings of the unconscious mind. He developed his first theory of the psyche in _The Interpretation of Dreams_ (1900), in which he stated that the unconscious is where dreams and all the automatic thoughts that arise spontaneously without a recognisable cause are formed. The unconscious is where the forgotten memories lie in a dormant state and they may become accessible to the conscious mind at a later time. It is also the container of implicit knowledge that has been passed down from generation to generation.

##### Id, ego and superego

Freud believed that our personality develops through interaction between the three main parts of the human mind: the id, ego and superego

The id is the most primitive. Within the id are all the inherited components of personality we are born with, including the sex instinct, the Eros and the instinct towards aggression. The id operates entirely unconsciously; it does not change with time or experience, since it is not related to the external world.

The ego is the rational, pragmatic part of our personality. It is less primitive than the id and is both conscious and unconscious; it represents what may be called reason and common sense. Freud used the word ego' to mean a set of psychic functions such as judgement, tolerance, reality testing, control, planning, defence, synthesis of information, intellectual functioning and memory

The superego is concerned with social rules and morals, and covers what many would refer to as conscience. It develops around the age of 3-5 and it consists of two systems, the conscience and the ideal self. The conscience is a part that can punish the ego by making it feel guilty. The ideal self, on the other hand, creates an imaginary picture of how you ought to be, and deals with ambition and social behaviour, including how to treat others and how to be a useful member of society.

According to Freud, the id, ego and superego are in constant conflict so that adult personality and behaviour are derived directly from the results of these internal childhood struggles.

##### The Oedipus complex

Freud believed that a common source of psychic conflict derived from sexual fantasies in childhood and this theory seemed obscene to the respectable public at that time. The most famous example of conflict is the Oedipus complex, which is probably the most controversial of all his theories of relationships. In 1909 Freud wrote a paper, _Analysis of a Phobia in a Five-Year-Old Boy_, in which he outlined the fear of horses of a boy known as 'Little Hans'. Freud believed that the boy's terror was due to feelings of anger related to his parents he had internalised. According to Freud, all small boys choose their mother as their primary object of desire. They subconsciously wish to usurp their father and become their mother's lover. These desires appear between the ages of 3 and 5. when a boy is in what Freud defined as the phallic stage of development. This stage represents an important point in the formation of sexual identity. The analogous experience for girls is known as the Electra complex, in which girls feel desire for their father and jealousy of their mother. The child, however, suspects that acting on these feelings would lead to danger, thus he/she represses his/her desires. This leads to anxiety. In order to resolve the conflict. the boy then identifies with his father and the girl with her mother. It is at this point that the superego is formed; it becomes an internalisation of the parental figure that strives to suppress the id's impulses and make the ego act upon these idealistic standards.

##### Adler and Jung

Although Freud's second masterpiece _Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality_ (1905) further alienated him from contemporary psychiatry, he soon found loyal disciples. They founded the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society in 1908. However, some of them moved away from their master; the two best known were Alfred Adler (1870-1937) and Carl Gustav Jung 6.3]. Adler highlighted the importance of the aggression with which those people who lack some quality they desire express their discontent. Inferiority complex, a much abused term, is Adlerian.


### Jung

An other important figure was Carl Gustav Jung. He was a swiss philosopher and psychologist. He developed the theory of the **collective unconscious**. It is a set of belief that we inherit from the past, and it is such a cultural memory, containing the universal images and beliefs of the human race. This meant that some figures or objects of the everyday world had great symbolic power, and people responded to them unconsciously.

The role of the artist was to bring these archetypes to the surface.

### Albert Einstein

The growing crisis of confidence was also due to the introduction of 'relativity' in science. Albert Einstein's theory of relativity discarded the concepts of time and space: even time and space are subjective. The world view lost its solidity and the scientific revolution was complemented by verbal experimentation and the exploration of memory in literature.

### Henry Bergson

He was a french philosopher who said that time can be divided into **historical time** and **psychological time**.
1. **Historical time** is the eternal time, which is objective and can be measured by a clock.
2. **Psychological time** is internal and subjective: we can measure it by emotions and feelings.

He introduced the concept of **duration**, to highlight the subjective dimension of time, because it is made by past, present and future that overload each other.

### Anthropological studies

In the social sphere, increasing knowledge tended to shake faith in the assumed rightness of Western ways of behaviour. Sir James George Frazer's (1854-1941) _The Golden Bough_ (1890) and other studies of anthropology helped undermine the absolute truth of religious and ethical systems in favour of more relativist standpoints. Primitive societies began to be regarded as integrated structures and, as a result, a large variety of forms of social organisation was analysed and made known.

### A new picture of man

The problem that lay behind all these manifestations of uncertainty was the inability to arrive at a commonly accepted picture of man. To Freud man was a part of nature, a biological and psychological phenomenon; to Marx he was the outcome of social and economic forces.

### Nietzsche

He introduce the concept related to the objectivity of truth.
He questioned the objectivity of truth. There is no more an universal truth

In _Thus spoke Zarathrusta_ he said that 'God is dead'. He uses this expression to refer to the end of the beliefs of a cosmic figure that orders everything. Under the influence of the ideas of the German philosopher Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (1844-1900), who had declared that 'God is dead' and had substituted Christian morality with a belief in human power and perfectibility, the Christian notion of man as owing his possibilities of salvation to God's grace lost its former strength. Though Christianity underwent revivals of interest, religious controversy no longer vitally affected public issues. More and more people became aware that there were alternatives to Christianity and some intellectuals turned to esoteric beliefs.


### William James

He was an american philosopher and he discussed the notion of the **stream of consciousness**. This is a psychic phenomenon referred to the flowing of thoughts, emotions, memories and feelings, that occurs in human mind.

## Modernism

It refers to an international movement that involved different types of artistic expression: it wasn't only a literary movement because it also involved **music**, **cinema** and the **visual arts**.

It is a transversal movemente, since it covers a wide variety of attitude:
* escalation in artistic innovation
* the epicentre is considered to be Paris
* modernism drew inspiration from everywhere: past, foreign literatures or artistic expressions.

### Features

#### Literary Movement
As a **literary movement** it is tipically associated with the period after WWI. There is a **fragmentation** of the values of the past, since the present is confused.

In this context there is an element which is common to all the modernists, that is the desire to break with tradition, and express new ways of expression; in order to break with the past, they rejected the typical narrative techniques of the past.
They found a solution in the inner world: they wanted to emphasize the subjective dimension. **Subjectivism** is an other key concept

#### Artistic movement
As an **artistic movement** features are
* **distortion of shapes**, particularly visibile in arts with cubism (Picasso and George Braque), which introduced this new way of representing the world
* they didn't want to reproduce reality as it was, but they try to rebuilt reality with a serie of geometrical shapes, such as cones, cilinder, spheres, reassembling them offering a new vision of the world, to highlight that there is not just a single reality, that there is **no objective truth**.

#### Music movement
As a **music movement**, we have Stravinsky. He was famous because he put into dialogue different styles from different epoques, and in so doing he produces a dissonant result.

### Modern Poetry

At the turn of the century poetry was characterised by an high degree of fragmentation: poetry developed in different paths and different branches; some were more traditional, and other were more experimental.

#### Georgian Poets
Talking about the more traditional branch of modern poetry there is the **georgian poets**. This name come from the tile of an anthology which was published during the reign of George V.

This name was associated to tradition, to convention, since the Georgian poet were still close to the tradition of the previous centuries. They did not experiment with poetry; on the contrary they were mostly hostile against any form of innovation.

#### War poets
The **war poets** focused on war; they dealt with this concepts in very different ways: we can identify two different branches:
* Some poets exalted the glories of war; they were moved by a feeling of patriotism and they exalted the glories of war, and probably the most representative poet is *Rupert Brooke*. This is a traditional branch
* An other group, on the contrary, was against this false propaganda by the political authorities of the time who pushed young man to join the army and fight and die for the country, and for which the war was a good thing. They wanted to end this because they showed the horrors of war, the terrible conditions in which soldiers lives in the trench; many of them took part in WWI. This is an innovative branch. They paved the way for modernists poetry. The main representative was Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sasson.

#### Imagism
Imagism is an other branch of modern poetry, whose main poet was Ezra Pound. Imagist focused on a single image and scene, and they were characterised by a sense of complete freedom in the choice of subject matter.

The main features are:
* They focused on a single image, object, scene
* They felt completely free in the choice of subject matter
* They made use of a clear, precise and concise language
* Their poems were usually very short
* Their aim was to reach the truth of objects, precision
* They rejected the conventions of the past, and for instance they adopted free verse: they didn’t follow a metrical regularity: some of these features were to became characteristic of the whole Modernism

#### Symbolism
The main representative was the American poet T.S. Eliot and the Irish poet W.B. Yeats.

It was a loosely [vagamente organizzato] organized literally and artistic movements which originated with a group of french poet around the end of the 19 century. The main representative french symbolist was Baudelaire

The main features are
* The main focus was symbol: the symbolists preferred to evoke rather than to state and for this reason they made use of a suggestive and evocative language. They preferred to use indirect statements instead of directs
* Their poetry might seem hermetic, because each poet somehow invented his own symbolic system
* They wanted the reader to attribute their own meanings to the poems: they had to personally interprets the poems

#### Oxford Poets

In the ‘30s an other group of poets came on prominence.
Their name came from the fact that each of them studies at Oxford.

They were politically active on the left, and their main themes were social, justice, sense of community: they were socially and politically committed.

Their main focus was that of communicating with their fellow men, and in fact their style was simpler in comparison to the style used by the symbolists. They were afraid of the tyranny of fascists.

They wanted in their poems to point out a sort of moral cours of actions: they wanted to highlight a moral course of actions that completely contrasted those tyranysts.

Their main representative was the British Auden

#### New Romantics

In the ‘40s there was an other group of poets. Their name came for the fact that they rejected the intellectualism of the symbolists and the social and political commitment of the oxford poets.

 Their focus was about emotions. The main themes were
* Love
* Birth
* Death
* Sex

That’s why they were labelled **New romantics**.

### Modern Novel
WWI signed an epochal break with the past. The novel was essentially *bourgeois* in its origin: this means that when the novel emerges as a new literary genre it was meant as a mirror of society.

In the 18 century there was the rise of the novel, and the main focus was representing society; novel as a mirror of society. The main theme was **social mobility**, either upwards and downwards

Usually the novels had a linear structure, with a chronological sequence of events and their plots were well structured.

With the Great War, which shuttered people consciences, the modernists could no more represent society, since it was difficult: all the pillars on which society were based on totally collapsed.

In this contest of unrest and turmoil they were somehow forced by the circumstances to focus on their inner world instead of the outer world; they emphasize subjectivity; in this regard they were deeply influenced by Freud’s theories about the unconscious; they were very interested in the existence of different levels of consciousness and unconsciousness.
They were interested in how past experiences influences the adult behavior.

In order to deal with subjectivity they rejected the narrative techniques of the past: they were casually forced to do that, since it was impossible to represent the mind using the narrative techniques of the previous century.

The technique used in this period, to represent the constant flow of thoughts feeling and emotions, was the interior monologue. The interior monologue was the stylistic translation of the psychic phenomenon called *stream of consciousness*.

This phenomenon is based on the idea that thoughts bounds from past to present and future in the same time in our mind. There is a mixture of different temporal dimensions.

As a consequence the modernists rejected linear plots in their novels, and the events are not narrated according to a chronological order; they didn’t adopt a linear sequence of events in their novels. Since they focus on subjectivity and on the workings of the mind, in order to represent this unspoken activity of the mind, they were forced to mix past present and future: they couldn’t follow a chronological order in their novels; the easiest way years to translate this psychic phenomenon in their novels was the adoption of the *interior monologue*.

There are different types of interior monologue
* **indirect** interior monologue: we still have the guiding presence of a narrator; in the past the narrator played a key role in the development of the novel; here instead rejected the use of a third person omniscient narrator; even when we talk about the indirect interior monologue, and we actually have a narrator, this is a neutral presence, who filters the thoughts of the characters, with some introductive comments and explanations
* **direct** interior monologue: the character’s thoughts are given directly to the reader, without any filter.
