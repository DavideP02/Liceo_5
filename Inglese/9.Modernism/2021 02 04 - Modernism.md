## Modernism

It refers to an international movement that involved different types of artistic expression: it wasn't only a literary movement because it also involved **music**, **cinema** and the **visual arts**.

It is a transversal movemente, since it covers a wide variety of attitude:
* escalation in artistic innovation
* the epicentre is considered to be Paris
* modernism drew inspiration from everywhere: past, foreign literatures or artistic expressions.

### Features

As a **literary movement** it is tipically associated with the period after WWI. There is a **fragmentation** of the values of the past, since the present is confused.

In this context there is an element which is common to all the modernists, that is the desire to break with tradition, and express new ways of expression; in order to break with the past, they rejected the typical narrative techniques of the past.
They found a solution in the inner world: they wanted to emphasize the subjective dimension. **Subjectivism** is an other key concept

As an **artistic movement** features are
* **distortion of shapes**, particularly visibile in arts with cubism (Picasso and George Braque), which introduced this new way of representing the world
* they didn't want to reproduce reality as it was, but they try to rebuilt reality with a serie of geometrical shapes, such as cones, cilinder, spheres, reassembling them offering a new vision of the world, to highlight that there is not just a single reality, that there is **no objective truth**.

As a **music movement**, we have Stravinsky. He was famous because he put into dialogue different styles from different epoques, and in so doing he produces a dissonant result.

### Poetry

At the turn of the century poetry was characterised by an high degree of fragmentation: poetry developed in different paths and different branches; some were more traditional, and other were more experimental.

Talking about the more traditional branch of modern poetry there is the **georgian poets**. This name come from the tile of an anthology which was published during the reign of George V.

This name was associated to tradition, to convention, since the Georgian poet were still close to the tradition of the previous centuries. They did not experiment with poetry; on the contrary they were mostly hostile against any form of innovation.

The **war poets** focused on war; they dealt with this concepts in very different ways: we can identify two different branches:
* Some poets exalted the glories of war; they were moved by a feeling of patriotism and they exalted the glories of war, and probably the most representative poet is *Rupert Brooke*. This is a traditional branch
* An other group, on the contrary, was against this false propaganda by the political authorities of the time who pushed young man to join the army and fight and die for the country, and for which the war was a good thing. They wanted to end this because they showed the horrors of war, the terrible conditions in which soldiers lives in the trench; many of them took part in WWI. This is an innovative branch. They paved the way for modernists poetry. The main representative was Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sasson.

Imagism is an other branch of modern poetry, whose main poet was Ezra Pound. Imagist focused on a single image and scene, and they were characterised by a sense of complete freedom in the choice of subject matter.
