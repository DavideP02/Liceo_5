# Thomas Stearns Eliot

He is one of the most significant figure of the 20th century, he is one of the great innovator of the 20th century: he was a **poet**, a **playwright**, but also a **literary critic**.
He wrote almost nothing negligible.

He was born in Missouri, in **1888**. He study at Harvard and at the Sorbonne in Paris and at Oxford: those giving a cosmopolitan bent to his education.

At the outbreak of WWI he settled in London where he started to work first as a teacher and then as a Bank Clerk.

In **1914** he met the american poet **Ezra Pound**, with whom he would work closely on several major poems.
In **1915** he married Viven Haigh-Wood: she was a British ballad dancer, but the marriage was not a success since she suffered from mental instability.
In **1917** he published his first collection of poems _Prufrock and Other Observations_, which establish Eliot as an important avant-garde poet, with its vocal fragmentation and allusiveness, with its precision of imagery, its condemnation of the modern world, together with the ricorrence to a dry selfconscious wit, this poem establish Eliot as a modernist poet.

In **1922** he founded the influential literary journal _The Criterion_, which he also edited during the 17 years of its publication.
In **1925** he became director of the publishing house _Faber and Faber_.

After the publication of its first collection of poems, unhappily married, Eliot suffered from a nervous breakdown, and he spends some time in a sanatorium in Switzerland, where he underwent psychological treatment.
During this period poetry became officially its only shelter, as well as the tool to transcend his personal situation and to represent the general crisis of western culture.

In Switzerland he completed his famous poem _The Waste Land_ which was published in the first issue of _The Criterion_ after Ezra Pound revision and cuts. Eliot later dedicated this poem to his friend Ezra Pound.
This poem explored the disintegration of values in the modern world. It was highly innovative and it confirmed Elliot as a major poet and also as a significant spokesman for his generation.

In **1925** he published _The Hollow Man_. This poem can be read as a sequel to the despair expressed in _The Waste Land_.
In **1927** Elliot became a British citizen and it was about this time that he entered the Anglican Church finally finding the answer to his own uncertainties and to the despair of the modern world’s lack of faith and religion. (Eliot is American from birth)

The major works of this period expressed Eliot’s search for religious certainties and they include _Ash-Wednesday_ published in 1939 and the _Four Quartets_ published in 1943.
_Ash-Wednesday_ is a poem with a penitential and questioning mood whereas the _Four Quartets_ deals with the relation between time and eternity.

When his wife’s mental instability got worse Eliot placed her into a mental asylum where she later died provoking a strong sense of guilt in Eliot.
Ten years later he was happily remarried to his secretary.

During the 30’s Eliot also devoted himself to writing verse drama which he also continued writing during the 40’s and the 50’s. He isn’t only a poet, he is also a playwright and a literary critic.
All his plays mainly address directly or indirectly religious themes.

During his life Eliot proved to be an extremely prolific writer. He even wrote a book of poems for children which is called _Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats_ in 1939. This book was later transformed into the highly successful musical _Cats_.

During his life Eliot also wrote several works of criticism. He was an influential **literary critic** and in his critical essays he shared with the modern novelist **James Joyce** the view about the importance for the artist to be impersonal and to separate the man who suffers from the mind which creates.
He believed that the artist had to separate the man who suffers from the mind which he
creates.

The characters of his works are often archetypes of human beings who turn their own subjective experience into a universal form which anyone can identify with.
His idea was that impersonality must prevail over personality.

In 1948 he was awarded the **Nobel Prize for Literature** and he was internationally recognised as one of the most important poets of the century.
He died in London in 1965.

## Works

Eliot wrote in a period when new techniques were needed to express the complex realities of the so-called **Age of Anxiety**.

Even though a definitive interpretation of his work is not possible we can roughly divide his literary production into 2 periods: before and after his conversion to the Anglican Church.

### Before his conversion to the anglican church
The works of the first period show a pessimistic vision of the world and the main works belonging to this first phase are _Prufrock and Other Observations_, _The Waste Land_ and _The Hollow Man_.
All these poems expressed a certain nihilism (existence is useless) and reflects the sense of spiritual dryness of modern man.
### After his conversion to the anglican church
The works of the second period show a more optimistic vision. After entering the anglican Church his religious faith gave him an optimistic vision of the world and so from a mood of desolation Eliot turned into an ardent believer in Christian faith.

The main works belonging to this second phase are _The four quartets_, _Ash-Wednesday_ and his verse poems.

---

With his works Eliot represented the complexity of modern civilization. For Eliot this complexity resulted from the fragmentation of Western tradition which was the result of the Modern processes of industrialization, mass production and consumerism.

Alienated modern man no longer experiences a coherent sense of moral and religious community with his fellow man. His actions are no longer governed by a shared ethical code. The modern man is morally and spiritually empty.

Eliot sees his poetic mission as that of pissing together these broken worlds and finding redemption by creating a new symbolic system but inevitably such missions lead to a very difficult poetry.

## _The Waste Land_

The main theme is the **opposition** between the **sterility** of the modern world and the **fertility** of the past.

_The Waste Land_ is a complex, erudite, cryptic, spiritually earnest, occasionally lyrical poem, and it is one of the most recognizable poems of Modern Poetry

This poem was first published in 1922, and it was dedicated to Ezra Pound, who also played an important role in the editing of the poem.

This poem was acclaimed as the beginning of a new type of poetry, capable of expressing the post war sense of depression and futility.

With this poem Eliot he diagnosed the collapse of values that followed the bloodshed of WWI; it is characterised by shifting scenarios, multiple voices and changes in form.

The _Waste Land_ is a very long poem, structured in five different sections:
1. The Burial of the Dead
2. A Game of Chess
3. The Fire Sermon
4. Death by Water
5. What the Thunder Said

The first one (**The Burial of the Dead**), dealing with the coming of spring, in a sterile land, is centered on the basic opposition between **sterility** and **fertility**, **life** and **death**.

The second section (**A Game of Chess**) is based on the juxtaposition of present squalor, and past  ambiguous splendor.

**The Fire Sermon** reinforces the theme of squalor, and it introduces Tiresias, which is considered by Eliot the most important character in the poem.

**Death by Water** is based on the idea of purification by water.

**What the Thunder Said** conveys the image of the disintegration of western civilization and it suggest it possible salvation.
A possible solution is found in a sort of simpathy with other human beings, but anyway this solution does not modify the general atmosphere of desolation.

In addition to these five section, _The Waste Land_ also includes Eliot own notes, which explain some of his metaphors, allusions, quotations and half quotations.
Eliot uses several myths, legends and symbols, but he was acutely aware of the difficulty: including some notes aimed explaining his references.

Eliot drew inspiration from a wide range of sources:
- _The Bible_
- Dante's _Divina Commedia_
- Shakespheare
- French Symbolists
- Metaphysical poets, and John Donne
- Homer’s _Odyssey_
- Ovid's _Metamorphoses_
- _The Upanishads_, an Hindu sacred text.

In this regard Eliot openly declares that immature poets borrow, and major poets steal.
He was firmly convinced that past and present must coexist in poetry, and for this reason we are fully entitled to consider him at the same time as the most influential poet, but also as the most influent poet.

According to Eliot a poet should write universal poetry, drawing inspiration from everywhere: from the past, from the present, and from other countries.

### Style

The style of this poem is fragmentary: this stylistic fragmentation is evidente, first of all, from the structure of the poem itself, because although being a very long poem, _The Waste Land_ doesn't show the typical narrative structure of long poems: it seems more to be made up of a series of disjointed verse paragraphs, and the reader cannot easily follow the story.
There is the lack of an explicit link between the episodes described, and the reader cannot easily follow the poem.

Secondly, it sis fragmentary because of the mixture of different poetic style, which are meant to reproduce the chaos of modern civilization.
The poet creates sharp juxtaposition of different registers of speech.

_The Waste Land_ is also highly innovative in his use of language: its vocabulary is made up of words from several different languages: not only english, but even french, latin, german, sanskrit.

An other peculiarity of Eliot's style is that it requires the active participation of the reader, through the technique of implication: rather than using direct statements, Eliot prefers to use metaphor, similis and symbols to evoque emotions.
To this purpose, Eliot adopted what he called the **objective correlative**, which is the attempt at conveying and emotion without a direct explicit statement.
His style is evocative

Eliot Rejected an idea of poetry based on the poet's own personality, and he uses the objective correlative of symbolic meaningful imagery, which forces the reader to contribute to the poem, by bringing its own connotation to the gaps and by bringing its own meaning to the unstated.

### T: _The Burial of Dead_
- ==p. 206==

A funeral service in the Anglican rite is called "The Order of the Burial of the Dead". The title of the first section of _The Waste Land_ refers to it, since it is a metaphor for the condition of modern man, whose life is meaningless, empty, alienating and quite similar to death. In the passage that follows, traditional myths and symbols are used in an original way and acquire different and sometimes difficult connotations. This is why the poet himself added some notes to the edition in which the poem appeared.

This extract contains the beginning of the poem (**lines 1-7**) and the end of the poem's first section (**lines 8-24**)

_The Waste Land_ is a poem with an extraordinary symbolic and rythmical complexity, which breaks into many directions, from its very beginning.
It starts with a reference to April, as the "cruellest month" , while the reader usually associates Aprile to a month of renewal.

Then he breaks again with the common view by saying that Winter, generally associated with cold temperatures, keeps human beings warm, it turns to be positive.

In the second section is focused on the opposition between fertility and sterility, life and death. It contains one of the most surreal episodes of the whole poem: the speaker in fact walks through London, which is mentioned with the expression "unreal city" a reference to Baudelaire who used a similar expression to refer to Paris in one of his poems; London is the symbol of materialism, consumerism, because inhabited by creatures that look like walking ghosts, that stare and sight only in front of their feet. This is an idea of people who are totally absorbed by work that have lost the ability to communicate to each other. This image conveys an idea
of death within life and lack of communication

There is a sensation of unreality, due to:
- presence of people who look like walking ghosts
- presence of a brown fog at dawn which conveys an idea of unreal darkness
- the sound of the clock bell, which is a dead sound; the church bell no longer signife a call to prayer, but it signife a call to work; in the modern world, work has replaced the function of pray;

The speaker recognizes someone he knows among the crowd: he calls him Stetson. This is the name of an american large hat, which is usually wore by cowboys, and for this reason some critics see in this name a valid reference to Eliot's friend Ezra Pound (he used to wear this kind of hat). Eliot actually denied this connection.

The speaker connects his encounter to a memory of the Punic Wars. The two man fought together in the first Punic War (between Rome and Carthage).
This reference to the past world is meant to reproduce the present clashes of WWI.

It is difficult to analyze Eliot's poem, because there are so much references.

The speaker asks Stetson about the fate of a corps planted in his garden: he asks if the buried corps has already began to sprout; it is an ironic and comic description of the burial rite, as a form of gardening.

The section ends with a direct address to the reader:

> 'You! _hypocrite lecteur! - mon semblable, - mon frère!'_

This is a quotation from the preface of _Le fleur du mal_ of Baudelaire.
This final line connect the poet to the reader, since they both share a condition of spiritual emptiness and desolation.

The **style** is highly citatory: in this passage we find references to
- Dante's Inferno (when he describes the crowd of walking ghosts)
- Baudelaire's Parisians poems (at line 8 _unreal city_)
- Baudelaire's preface to _Le fleur du male_ (last line)
- at line 22 we have a reference to a minor 17th century dramatist's tragedy, John Webster's _The white devil_. Webster wrote
  > O Keep the Wolf far hence, that's fought to man

All these quotation make the text very complex, since there can be different levels of reading, according to how many references the reader is able to notice and appreciate.

Eliot makes use of free verse: lines are not of the same length, there is neither a regular scheme nor a traditional meter, and there isn't

### T: _The Fire Sermon_
- ==p. 208==

@import "Sermonp1.png" {width="300px"}
@import "Sermonp2.jpg" {width="300px"}

This passage introduces a key figure in the poem, **Tiresias**: he is the Theban prophet who was punished with blindness because he had seen Athen, the goddess of knowledge, bathing naked.

He became blind but he was able to see into the future: he was a seer.

This is divided into two section: the **first** (1-8) and the **second** (9-40)

Highlighted words:
- highlighted in **yellow**: description of the city of London, the external setting
- highlighted in **green**: description of the time
- highlighted in **light blue**: Mr Eugenides
- highlighted in **orange**: refers to the typist
- highlighted in **pink**: expression referred to Tiresias
- highlighted in **grey**: expression referred to the typist lover
- **pink** words: refers to the man's action and attitude
- **blue** words: typist's emotions and mood

#### First section

In the first section Tiresias is in London, which is the external setting; he is with Mr Eugenides: he is a merchant, whose name means "well born", someone of noble origin.
Now he is unkempt (trasandato), and he speaks vulgar french.

In this first section Mr Eugenides invites the narrator Tiresias to have lunch together and then he invites him to go to a hotel in Brighton, the Metropole, known for its sexual activity.

This scene evoke past and present time. Smyrna is a very ancient town, located in present Turkey, and so this is the image of an ancient merchant, but also there is the reference to the modern time, from the Hotel.

- **line 9**: _violet hour_: the sunset
- **line 12**: _I Tiresias_: it's the only explicit identification of the speaker

#### Second section

Tiresias assists to a squalid sexual encounter.

The setting in place changes: now the setting is a squalid untidied bedsitter, when we find a typist, who is waiting for her lover.

The setting in time: there is a mixture of past, present and future; Tiresias is a figure who comes from the past, and he has already experienced the events that he is now assisting to.

He is assisting to the squalid sexual encounter, in the present, and at the same time he is able to foretell the future.
Yet he cannot do anything to modify the future, he can only predict it.

Tiresia is an ermafrodite, because he was a man, and then he become a woman, and then he returned a man, so he posses the knowledge of both sexes.

He represents the supreme metamorphosis that brings the two sexes together.
He's qualified to summarize the whole human experience, He's qualified to assist to this sexual encounter.

The typist stands for the liberate woman of the early 1920s. She is independent and free, but this didn't bring her any happiness: she lives alone, in an untidied one room flat, full of uninteresting everyday objects; she lives an highly monotonous life. In this extract she is compared to a human engine, that act with automatic hand

The typist lover is a young man, carbuncular: carbuncul is an infection.

The typist is both morally and emotionally indifferent, bored and tired, but the man is not worried: he is only interested in his own satisfaction, he is only pleased with himself.

When he leaves her, he is satisfied. He is not able to grab the squalor he lived in.

Love is reduced to the fulfilment of mere instincts and physical desire: it's something practical and meaningless.

The typist's reaction to the young man is of pleasure for the end of the sexual encounter.

- **lines 49-50**: Renforces the impression of dullness, monotony and sterility. Their relationship is no more than a parody.

The themes developed are:

**Spiritual sterility and lack of communication**:
Eliot want to underline how impossible communication through love is in the wasteland; love has been reduced to mere lust. Eliot deals with this theme through the **objective correlative**: he describes this sexual encounter with a language that evokes the scene, and he doesn't describe it directly

**Negativity of city life**:
city life is only linked to commercial transactions, and this is evident from some metaphors and symbols that Eliot adopt here:
- **line 5**: _C.i.f._: it stands for "cost insurance and freight", this is a typical term of commercial transactions.
- the **typist**, who is the symbol of the liberated woman of the '20s

**Antithesis between past and present**:
this is evident through the juxtaposition of images belonging to the past and images belonging to the present
