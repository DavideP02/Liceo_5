# 15 apr 2021 - Thomas Stearns Eliot

## T: _The Fire Sermon_
- ==p. 208==

Tiresia is an ermafrodite, because he was a man, and then he become a woman, and then he returned a man, so he posses the knowledge of both sexes.

He represents the supreme metamorphosis that brings the two sexes together.
He's qualified to summarize the whole human experience, He's qualified to assist to this sexual encounter.

The typist stands for the liberate woman of the early 1920s. She is independent and free, but this didn't bring her any happiness: she lives alone, in an untidied one room flat, full of uninteresting everyday objects; she lives an highly monotonous life. In this extract she is compared to a human engine, that act with automatic hand

The typist lover is a young man, carbuncular: carbuncul is an infection.

The typist is both morally and emotionally indifferent, bored and tired, but the man is not worried: he is only interested in his own satisfaction, he is only pleased with himself.

When he leaves her, he is satisfied. He is not able to grab the squalor he lived in.

Love is reduced to the fulfilment of mere instincts and physical desire: it's something practical and meaningless.

The typist's reaction to the young man is of pleasure for the end of the sexual encounter.

- **lines 49-50**: Renforces the impression of dullness, monotony and sterility. Their relationship is no more than a parody.

The themes developed are:

**Spiritual sterility and lack of communication**:
Eliot want to underline how impossible communication through love is in the wasteland; love has been reduced to mere lust. Eliot deals with this theme through the **objective correlative**: he describes this sexual encounter with a language that evokes the scene, and he doesn't describe it directly

**Negativity of city life**:
city life is only linked to commercial transactions, and this is evident from some metaphors and symbols that Eliot adopt here:
- **line 5**: _C.i.f._: it stands for "cost insurance and freight", this is a typical term of commercial transactions.
- the **typist**, who is the symbol of the liberated woman of the '20s

**Antithesis between past and present**:
this is evident through the juxtaposition of images belonging to the past and images belonging to the present
