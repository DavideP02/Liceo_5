# 8 apr 2021 - Thomas Sterns Eliot

## The Waste Land

The main theme is the opposition between the sterility of the modern world and the fertility of the past.

_The Waste Land_ is a complex, erudite, cryptic, spiritually earnest, occasionally lyrical poem, and it is one of the most recognizable poems of Modern Poetry

This poem was first published in 1922, and it was dedicated to Ezra Pound, who also played an important role in the editing of the poem.

This poem was acclaimed as the beginning of a new type of poetry, capable of expressing the post war sense of depression and futility.

With this poem Eliot he diagnosed the collapse of values that followed the bloodshed of WWI; it is characterised by shifting scenarios, multiple voices and changes in form.

The _Waste Land_ is a very long poem, structured in five different sections:
1. The Burial of the Dead
2. A Game of Chess
3. The Fire Sermon
4. Death by Water
5. What the Thunder Said

The first one (**The Burial of the Dead**), dealing with the coming of spring, in a sterile land, is centered on the basic opposition between **sterility** and **fertility**, **life** and **death**.

The second section (**A Game of Chess**) is based on the juxtaposition of present squalor, and past  ambiguous splendor.

**The Fire Sermon** reinforces the theme of squalor, and it introduces Tiresias, which is considered by Eliot the most important character in the poem.

**Death by Water** is based on the idea of purification by water.

**What the Thunder Said** conveys the image of the disintegration of western civilization and it suggest it possible salvation.
A possible solution is found in a sort of simpathy with other human beings, but anyway this solution does not modify the general atmosphere of desolation.

In addition to these five section, _The Waste Land_ also includes Eliot own notes, which explain some of his metaphors, allusions, quotations and half quotations.
Eliot uses several myths, legends and symbols, but he was acutely aware of the difficulty: including some notes aimed explaining his references.

Eliot drew inspiration from a wide range of sources:
- _The Bible_
- Dante's _Divina Commedia_
- Shakespheare
- French Symbolists
- Metaphysical poets, and John Donne
- Homerâ€™s _Odyssey_
- Ovid's _Metamorphoses_
- _The Upanishads_, an Hindu sacred text.

In this regard Eliot openly declares that immature poets borrow, and major poets steal.
He was firmly convinced that past and present must coexist in poetry, and for this reason we are fully entitled to consider him at the same time as the most influential poet, but also as the most influent poet.

According to Eliot a poet should write universal poetry, drawing inspiration from everywhere: from the past, from the present, and from other countries.

### Style

The style of this poem is fragmentary: this stylistic fragmentation is evidente, first of all, from the structure of the poem itself, because although being a very long poem, _The Waste Land_ doesn't show the typical narrative structure of long poems: it seems more to be made up of a series of disjointed verse paragraphs, and the reader cannot easily follow the story.
There is the lack of an explicit link between the episodes described, and the reader cannot easily follow the poem.

Secondly, it sis fragmentary because of the mixture of different poetic style, which are meant to reproduce the chaos of modern civilization.
The poet creates sharp juxtaposition of different registers of speech.

_The Waste Land_ is also highly innovative in his use of language: its vocabulary is made up of words from several different languages: not only english, but even french, latin, german, sanskrit.

An other peculiarity of Eliot's style is that it requires the active participation of the reader, through the technique of implication: rather than using direct statements, Eliot prefers to use metaphor, similis and symbols to evoque emotions.
To this purpose, Eliot adopted what he called the **objective correlative**, which is the attempt at conveying and emotion without a direct explicit statement.
His style is evocative

Eliot Rejected an idea of poetry based on the poet's own personality, and he uses the objective correlative of symbolic meaningful imagery, which forces the reader to contribute to the poem, by bringing its own connotation to the gaps and by bringing its own meaning to the unstated.

### T: _The Burial of Dead_

@import "P. 206 - The Burial of The Dead.jpg"

_The Waste Land_ is a poem with an extraordinary symbolic and rythmical complexity, which breaks into many directions, from its very beginning.
It starts with a reference to April, as the "cruellest month" , while the reader usually associates Aprile to a month of renewal.

Then he breaks again with the common view by saying that Winter, generally associated with cold temperatures, keeps human beings warm, it turns to be positive.

In the second section is focused on the opposition between fertility and sterility, life and death. It contains one of the most surreal episodes of the whole poem: the speaker in fact walks through London, which is mentioned with the expression "unreal city" a reference to Baudelaire who used a similar expression to refer to Paris in one of his poems; London is the symbol of materialism, consumerism, because inhabited by creatures that look like walking ghosts, that stare and sight only in front of their feet. This is an idea of people who are totally absorbed by work that have lost the ability to communicate to each other. This image conveys an idea
of death within life and lack of communication
