There is a sensation of unreality, due to:
- presence of people who look like walking ghosts
- presence of a brown fog at dawn which conveys an idea of unreal darkness
- the sound of the clock bell, which is a dead sound; the church bell no longer signife a call to prayer, but it signife a call to work; in the modern world, work has replaced the function of pray;

The speaker recognizes someone he knows among the crowd: he calls him Stetson. This is the name of an american large hat, which is usually wore by cowboys, and for this reason some critics see in this name a valid reference to Eliot's friend Ezra Pound (he used to wear this kind of hat). Eliot actually denied this connection.

The speaker connects his encounter to a memory of the Punic Wars. The two man fought together in the first Punic War (between Rome and Carthage).
This reference to the past world is meant to reproduce the present clashes of WWI.

It is difficult to analyze Eliot's poem, because there are so much references.

The speaker asks Stetson about the fate of a corps planted in his garden: he asks if the buried corps has already began to sprout; it is an ironic and comic description of the burial rite, as a form of gardening.

The section ends with a direct address to the reader:

> 'You! _hypocrite lecteur! - mon semblable, - mon frÃ¨re!'_

This is a quotation from the preface of _Le fleur du mal_ of Baudelaire.
This final line connect the poet to the reader, since they both share a condition of spiritual emptiness and desolation.

The **style** is highly citatory: in this passage we find references to
- Dante's Inferno (when he describes the crowd of walking ghosts)
- Baudelaire's Parisians poems (at line 8 _unreal city_)
- Baudelaire's preface to _Le fleur du male_ (last line)
- at line 22 we have a reference to a minor 17th century dramatist's tragedy, John Webster's _The white devil_. Webster wrote
  > O Keep the Wolf far hence, that's fought to man

All these quotation make the text very complex, since there can be different levels of reading, according to how many references the reader is able to notice and appreciate.

Eliot makes use of free verse: lines are not of the same length, there is neither a regular scheme nor a traditional meter, and there isn't


## T: _The Fire Sermon_
- ==p. 208==

This passage introduces a key figure in the poem, **Tiresias**: he is the Theban prophet who was punished with blindness because he had seen Athen, the goddess of knowledge, bathing naked.

He became blind but he was able to see into the future: he was a seer.

This is divided into two section: the **first** (1-8) and the **second** (9-40)

### First section

In the first section Tiresias is in London, which is the external setting; he is with Mr Eugenides: he is a merchant, whose name means "well born", someone of noble origin.
Now he is unkempt (trasandato), and he speaks vulgar french.

In this first section Mr Eugenides invites the narrator Tiresias to have lunch together and then he invites him to go to a hotel in Brighton, the Metropole, known for its sexual activity.

This scene evoke past and present time. Smyrna is a very ancient town, located in present Turkey, and so this is the image of an ancient merchant, but also there is the reference to the modern time, from the Hotel.

### Second section

Tiresias assists to a squalid sexual encounter.

The setting in place changes: now the setting is a squalid untidied bedsitter, when we find a typist, who is waiting for her lover.

The setting in time: there is a mixture of past, present and future; Tiresias is a figure who comes from the past, and he has already experienced the events that he is now assisting to.

He is assisting to the squalid sexual encounter, in the present, and at the same time he is able to foretell the future.
Yet he cannot do anything to modify the future, he can only predict it.
