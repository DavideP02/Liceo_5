# 26 mar 2021 - Thomas Stearns Eliot

He is one of the most significant figure of the 20th century, he is one of the great innovator of the 20th century: he was a poet, a playwright, but also a literary critic.
He wrote almost nothing negligible.

He was born in Missouri, in 1888. He study at Harvard and at the Sorbonne in Paris and at Oxford: those giving a cosmopolitan bent to his education.

At the outbreak of WWI he settled in London where he started to work first as a teacher and then as a Bank Clerk.

In 1914 he met the american poet Ezra Pound, with whom he would work closely on several major poems.
In 1915 he married Viven Haigh-Wood: she was a British ballad dancer, but the marriage was not a success since she suffered from mental instability.
In 1917 he published his first collection of poems _Prufrock and Other Observations_, which establish Eliot as an important avant-garde poet, with its vocal fragmentation and allusiveness, with its precision of imagery, its condemnation of the modern world, together with the ricorrence to a dry selfconscious wit, this poem establish Eliot as a modernist poet.

In 1922 he founded the influential literary journal _The Criterion_, which he also edited during the 17 years of its publication.
In 1925 he became director of the publishing house _Faber and Faber_.

After the publication of its first collection of poems, unhappily married, Eliot suffered from a nervous breakdown, and he spends some time in a sanatorium in Switzerland, where he underwent psychological treatment.
During this period poetry became officially its only shelter, as well as the tool to transcend his personal situation and to represent the general crisis of western culture.

In Switzerland he completed his famous poem _The Waste Land_, which was published in the first issue of _The Criterion_ after Ezra Pound revision and cuts.
Eliot later dedicated this poem to his friend Ezra Pound
