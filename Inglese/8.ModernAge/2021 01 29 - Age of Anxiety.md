## The crisis of certainties

The First World War left Britain in a disillusioned and cynical mood: some soldiers celebrated their return home with a frantic search for pleasure; others were haunted by a sense of guilt for the horrors of trench warfare, or missed the sense of purpose the war years had given them. The gap between the generation of the young and the older one, regarded as responsible for the terrible waste of lives during the war, grew wider and wider. An increasing feeling of rootlessness and frustration, due to the slow dissolution of the Empire into the Commonwealth, led to a transformation of the notions of imperial hegemony and white superiority.
Writers like Edward Morgan Forster became averse to political subjection and thought in terms of personal relationships based on equality and feeling. The committed writers of the 1930s and 1940s like Wystan Hugh Auden and George Orwell warned their readers against totalitarianism.
Nothing seemed to be right or certain: scientists and philosophers destroyed the old, predictable universe which had sustained the Victorians in their optimistic outlook, and new views of man and the universe that had emerged at the beginning of the century spread through society.

## Freud

He is an Austrian psychologist, founder of the psychoanalysis. He published the _Interpretation of dreams_ in 1900: in this essay he analyses the unconscious. There are 2 components in our mind, and the unconscious is the most important one. There is something inside us that pushes us to do or not to do something: this hidden force operate somehow in an unconscious way. His theory was quite disturbing at that time because he stated that we are in some way non controlled. The discovery that man's actions could be motivated by irrational forces of which he might know nothing is very disturbing.

Human mind is formed by the **ID**, the **EGO** and the **SUPEREGO**.
1. The **id** is the most instinctual part and the most primitive; it's where we have our impulses, such as sex instinct, eros, aggressivity; it doesn't change with time, and it is not related to the external world.
2. The **ego** is the part of our mind related to rationality.
3. The **superego** is subdivided in 2 components: the **moral conscience**, which has the role to feel us guilty; the role of the **ideaself** is to show us how we should behave.

The ego has a mediation role between the impulses and our morality. According to him the unconscious is the post important part and dreams are the only way to enter the unconscious. Dreams are the key to access and to analyze our mind, and in particular the unconscious component of our mind.

He used a method called **free association of ideas** in order to investigate our mind, and this concept strongly influenced the modern age.

His theory also placed enormous importance on the demands of the 'libido', particularly those manifested in Oedipus phase.
The Freudian concept of infantile sexuality focused attention on the importance of early development, and childhood regained a status it had only in the pages of Rousseau.

## Jung

An other important figure was Carl Gustav Jung. He was a swiss philosopher and psychologist. He developed the theory of the **collective unconscious**. It is a set of belief that we inherit from the past, and it is such a cultural memory, containing the universal images and beliefs of the human race. This meant that some figures or objects of the everyday world had great symbolic power, and people responded to them unconsciously.

## Albert Einstein

The growing crisis of confidence was also due to the introduction of 'relativity' in science. Albert Einstein's theory of relativity discarded the concepts of time and space: even time and space are subjective. The world view lost its solidity and the scientific revolution was complemented by verbal experimentation and the exploration of memory in literature.

## Henry Bergson

He was a french philosopher who said that time can be divided into **historical time** and **psychological time**.
1. **Historical time** is the eternal time, which is objective and can be measured by a clock.
2. **Psychological time** is internal and subjective: we can measure it by emotions and feelings.

## Anthropological studies

In the social sphere, increasing knowledge tended to shake faith in the assumed rightness of Western ways of behaviour. Sir James George Frazer's (1854-1941) _The Golden Bough_ (1890) and other studies of anthropology helped undermine the absolute truth of religious and ethical systems in favour of more relativist standpoints. Primitive societies began to be regarded as integrated structures and, as a result, a large variety of forms of social organisation was analysed and made known.

## A new picture of man

The problem that lay behind all these manifestations of uncertainty was the inability to arrive at a commonly accepted picture of man. To Freud man was a part of nature, a biological and psychological phenomenon; to Marx he was the outcome of social and economic forces. Under the influence of the ideas of the German philosopher Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (1844-1900), who had declared that 'God is dead' and had substituted Christian morality with a belief in human power and perfectibility, the Christian notion of man as owing his possibilities of salvation to God's grace lost its former strength. Though Christianity underwent revivals of interest, religious controversy no longer vitally affected public issues. More and more people became aware that there were alternatives to Christianity and some intellectuals turned to esoteric beliefs.

# Inter-war years

## Towards independence

The effort the dominions of the British Empire had made during the war created expectations of reward. In 1926 an imperial conference created a new entity from the dominions of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa with the name of 'Commonwealth. In 1931 the Statute of Westminster formally granted the sovereign right of each dominion to control its own domestic and foreign affairs and to establish its own diplomatic corps. India suffered regional and religious tensions accompanied by rising support for the Nationalist Congress Party. Steps towards self-government were being taken, under the pressure from Mohandas Gandhi's (1869-1948) non-cooperation movement, whose popular campaigns undermined the deference to British authority on which imperial rule depended. The Government of India Act in 1935 established self-government at a provincial level in the hope of maintaining Britain's control of the country as a whole.

## The Irish War of Independence

In the 1918 election in Ireland, the Sinn Féin party won almost all the seats except in the province of Ulster, but instead of going to Westminster, it set up an independent Parliament in Dublin - the Dáil - in 1919. The Irish Volunteers, a militant nationalist organisation founded in 1913, became the IRA (Irish Republican Army) and they declared open war on Britain in 1920, under the leadership of Michael Collins (1890 - 1922). The IRA terrorist attacks were brutally met by Black and Tan' police auxiliaries, culminating with 'Bloody Sunday' in 1920, when the 'Black and Tans' shot 12 dead at a football match in Dublin.
In 1921 an Anglo-Irish treaty established the Irish Free State, under the leadership of Eamon de Valera (1882-1975), as an independent State within the British Commonwealth. Only six counties centered on Protestant Ulster remained a self-governing province of the United Kingdom. In 1922 a civil war broke out in Ireland between those who accepted the Anglo-Irish Treaty and those who were against it. In 1923 the anti-Treaty faction, who wanted the inclusion of the six counties of Ulster in the Republican Ireland, was defeated.

## The aftermath of WWI

The aftermath of World War I was marked by a world economic boom. A house-building programme started in Britain and there were improvements in public health; 40% of the population was covered by medical insurance. There was a boom in the sales of the daily press, Newspapers, which had been almost the only means of mass communication before the First World War, were supplemented in the 1920s by the development of radio broadcasting. In 1927 the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) was created.

However, the Wall Street Crash of 1929 dramatically affected life between the wars, since in the following year banks went bankrupt across Europe. The war had damaged Britain's position as the biggest exporter of manufactured goods because production had been turned to the war effort. Therefore, British customers had found new suppliers in South America and Asia. Working hours were cut, prices fell but the attempt to cut wages was resisted by the trade unions. There were miners' strikes and a General Strike was called in 1926. The most urgent inter-war issue was unemployment and the gap between North and South took on a new dimension: the once powerful industrial North became depressed and challenged by new growing automobile, chemical and electrical goods industries in the South and the Midlands, Restoring demand to the iron and steel industries began with rearmament in 1936.

## The difficult 1930s

From 1935, Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin (1923-37) led a Conservative government which was opposed to another war. He had to make controversial decisions regarding the abdication crisis of 1936 and rearmament. The popular young king, Edward VIII, who had succeeded his father George V, wanted to marry a twice divorced American woman. Baldwin forced his abdication on the grounds that he could not marry her and keep the throne. The king's brother succeeded as George VI (1936-52). As for rearmament, the need for a strong Royal Air Force (RAF) independent of the army and the navy led the British government to shift spending onto the RAF. At the same time a ship-building programme was funded aimed at a 'two-ocean fleet'.

## Towards World War II

In 1935 the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini (1883-1945) attacked the African monarchy of Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and took the first steps towards an alliance with Germany, where Adolf Hitler (1889-1945) and his Nazi Party had come to power in 1933. Hitler sent troops illegally into the Rhineland in 1936. In the same year a three-year long civil war started in Spain between Nationalists and Republicans. A crisis also began in the East with a Japanese attack on China in 1937.
Hitler invaded Austria in 1938 proclaiming its union with Germany and breaking the Treaty of Versailles. In November 1938 Kristallnacht, organised violence against Jewish people and property in Germany took place, followed by the occupation of Prague in March 1939. In August Hitler signed the secret Molotov Ribbentrop non-aggression pact with Stalin (1879-1953) and on 1st September he invaded Poland. Two days later Britain and France declared war on Germany.

# The Second World War

## The beginning of the war

When war began in 1939, in Britain evacuation schemes were organised to move people, especially children, from the towns and cities; hospital patients were sent home to release beds; the paintings of the National Gallery were stored in mines in North Wales and underground stations soon became shelters for civilians during night-time raids. The United Kingdom sent British troops to aid in the defence of France.

In April 1940 Hitler invaded Norway and Denmark by sea and air, because about a third of Germany's iron ore supply came from Scandinavia. In May there was a sudden German attack on Holland and Belgium, while German tank corps were heading for Paris. British Prime Minister Chamberlain (1937-40) resigned in 1940 and Sir Winston Churchill took over (1940-45). The British ordered the retreat of their troops to Dunkirk, where they had to be lifted from the beaches by Royal Navy ships and private boats whose owners volunteered to bring back our boys Meanwhile Japan overran Hong Kong and Burma (now Myanmar) and began to threaten Singapore and India. America kept aloof despite Churchill's constant appeals for help.

## Operation Sea Lion

Hitler was planning the invasion of Britain, Operation Sea Lion. The Luftwaffe, the German air force, had to put Britain's defence in the Southeast out of action, in order to open the way for the sea invasion. In 1940 the Battle of Britain saw English and German bombers fighting in the skies over Sussex and Kent. The battle was won by Britain, but Hitler changed his strategy and ordered the 'Blitz, an intense bombing of civilian targets in London and other cities, with the aim of weakening the enemy. King George VI and his wife Elizabeth refused to leave London and remained in Buckingham Palace, becoming symbols of resistance. In spite of the devastation and the deaths of thousands of civilians, the British people did not fall into submission.

## Operation Barbarossa

In 1941 German forces advanced south and east, and in Africa General Rommel forced the British army to retreat. In June Hitler decided to declare war on the Soviet Union because he wanted to get the oilfields in the Caucasus region. The so-called 'Operation Barbarossa was the largest military operation in history and would consume Germany's resources for the rest of the war.

## America joined the war

In December 1941 Japan bombed the US fleet in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. President Franklin D. Roosevelt (1932-45) declared war on Japan, and Germany declared war on America. The Japanese quickly advanced in the Far East. In 1942, with the Battle of Midway Island, the US fleet sank four Japanese aircraft carriers, weakening the Japanese position in the Pacific. In November 1942 General Montgomery defeated Rommel at El-Alamein, thus preventing the fall of Egypt. In July 1943 the Allies landed in Sicily led by General George Patton, and a long fight up Italian territory began. Germany's advance eastward was stopped by their defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad, where the Soviet forces surrounded and crushed an entire German army. This was a turning point in the war. The Allies continued to score victories against the Germans, also helped by the science of sonar, radar and the Enigma code-breaking computer. In the summer of 1944 the Allies entered Rome and decided to open a western front in France.

## Operation Overlord

The greatest amphibious force in history arrived on the beaches of Normandy on 6th June 1944, also known as D-Day. The Germans retreated across France and counter-attacked at the Battle of the Bulge in the Belgian Ardennes in December 1944. General Patton's forces played a key role in defeating the German counter-attack, after which they went across the Rhine River and into Germany.

## The end of the war

The Soviet Red Army was slowly advancing, liberating Poland, Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Austria and the eastern fringes of Germany. On 30th April 1945 Hitler committed suicide, and Berlin fell on 2nd May. At the Yalta Conference in Crimea in February 1945, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill and Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin made important decisions concerning the future progress of the war and the post-war world. The war ended in Europe on 8th May 1945 but it took another three months to defeat Japan in the Far East. Victory came only with the explosion of two atomic bombs on the Japanese towns of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6th and 9th August. The atomic bombing ended World War II and began a new age.
