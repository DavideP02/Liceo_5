# 22 gen 2021 - The Edwardian Age
* ==pp. 156-157==

The **Edwardian Age** begins in the 1901, after the end of the Victorian Age. After Queen Victorian reign her son Edward became king as **king Edward VII**. He will reign till 1910.
1901 is an important year, since it represents the border between the two ages.
Talking about the Edwardian age we refer to a period which extends to the begins of the WWI.

At that time Britain was one of the richest nations of the globe, and the Britain Empire covered at least one fifth of the whole globe. British economy was been challenged by other economies, by France, Germany and the US. Germany had imperial ambitions too, which finally lead to one of the great crisis in history.

King Edward VII was a fine diplomat. In this situation in 1904 he signed an agreement with France, called **Entente Cordiale**: Britain could pursuit its interests in Egypt while France could pursuit its interests in Morocco.
This agreement will be included in the **Triple Entente** [Triplice alleanza], which was an agreement between Britain, France and Russia. It was made to counterbalance the **Triple Alliance**, between Germany, Austria and Italy.

## Society

The society during this period was really similar to the one of previous age, whit class distinctions, a widespread poverty.

In 1906 there were the political election in Britain, won by the liberals; they made significant reforms: at the time the liberals were internally divided into two groups:
* Liberals who supported the traditional liberal values
* An other group, called *new liberalism* was in favour of certain form of State intervention in social life

Among the new liberals there was David Lloyd Georg, which was the Chancellor of the Exchequer [erario]: he was in charge of the Country’s finances. This group managed to make some reforms, such as the **foundation of the welfare state**.

In 1910 King Edward VII died, and his son George V became king.

The first decade of the 20th century was a period of political, social and cultural debate.
In 1909 minimum wages were fixed; in 1911 workers were given benefits such as free medical treatment and sickness.

## Suffragettes

**Suffragettes** are part of a movement who fought for the rights of women, such as the right to vote (as men could do). In Great Britain the leader was Emmeline Pankhurst, who found a movement called *Women’s Social and Political Union*. At the begin they fought peacefully, but this never lead to anything. They started to fight in a more violent way to reach their aim: they chained themselves at fences, they broke windows, they spat at the policemen. A lot of them were sent to prison, where they felt as political prisoners, and so many of them went on hunger strikes as a form of protest.
Eventually, in 1918 rich women over 30 obtain the right to vote, but they had to wait until 1928 for the universal suffrage.

## World War One

The event that triggered the outbreak of WWI was the **murder** of the archduke **Franz Ferdinand** in Sarajevo by a serbian nationalist.

After this, Austria started bombarding Belgrade.

Then Germany invaded Belgium, as an alternative way to invade France, and declared war to France and Russia.

So the UK declared war, since Germany was challenging Britain at the control of sea. The UK understood that this war was not going to be short; it understood that in order to win it, it needed soldiers and a stronger army. Volunteers were accepted but it was difficult to turn volunteers into soldiers, so it was introduced the **conscription** (leva militare) and when they did that a lot of women replaced men on job, and they proved to be as good as men. So this event helped to reach the universal suffrage.
