# Modern Age

## The Edwardian Age

The **Edwardian Age** begins in the 1901, after the end of the Victorian Age. After Queen Victorian reign her son Edward became king as **king Edward VII**. He will reign till 1910.
1901 is an important year, since it represents the border between the two ages.
Talking about the Edwardian age we refer to a period which extends to the begins of the WWI.

At that time Britain was one of the richest nations of the globe, and the Britain Empire covered at least one fifth of the whole globe. British economy was been challenged by other economies, by France, Germany and the US. Germany had imperial ambitions too, which finally lead to one of the great crisis in history.

King Edward VII was a fine diplomat. In this situation in 1904 he signed an agreement with France, called **Entente Cordiale**: Britain could pursuit its interests in Egypt while France could pursuit its interests in Morocco.
This agreement will be included in the **Triple Entente** [Triplice alleanza], which was an agreement between Britain, France and Russia. It was made to counterbalance the **Triple Alliance**, between Germany, Austria and Italy.

### Society

The society during this period was really similar to the one of previous age, whit class distinctions, a widespread poverty.

In 1906 there were the political election in Britain, won by the liberals; they made significant reforms: at the time the liberals were internally divided into two groups:
* Liberals who supported the traditional liberal values
* An other group, called *new liberalism* was in favour of certain form of State intervention in social life

Among the new liberals there was David Lloyd Georg, which was the Chancellor of the Exchequer [erario]: he was in charge of the Country’s finances. This group managed to make some reforms, such as the **foundation of the welfare state**.

In 1910 King Edward VII died, and his son George V became king.

The first decade of the 20th century was a period of political, social and cultural debate.
In 1909 minimum wages were fixed; in 1911 workers were given benefits such as free medical treatment and sickness.

### Suffragettes

**Suffragettes** are part of a movement who fought for the rights of women, such as the right to vote (as men could do). In Great Britain the leader was Emmeline Pankhurst, who found a movement called *Women’s Social and Political Union*. At the begin they fought peacefully, but this never lead to anything. They started to fight in a more violent way to reach their aim: they chained themselves at fences, they broke windows, they spat at the policemen. A lot of them were sent to prison, where they felt as political prisoners, and so many of them went on hunger strikes as a form of protest.
Eventually, in 1918 rich women over 30 obtain the right to vote, but they had to wait until 1928 for the universal suffrage.

## World War One

The event that triggered the outbreak of WWI was the **murder** of the archduke **Franz Ferdinand** in Sarajevo by a serbian nationalist.

After this, Austria started bombarding Belgrade.

Then Germany invaded Belgium, as an alternative way to invade France, and declared war to France and Russia.

So the UK declared war, since Germany was challenging Britain at the control of sea. The UK understood that this war was not going to be short; it understood that in order to win it, it needed soldiers and a stronger army. Volunteers were accepted but it was difficult to turn volunteers into soldiers, so it was introduced the **conscription** (leva militare) and when they did that a lot of women replaced men on job, and they proved to be as good as men. So this event helped to reach the universal suffrage.

#### Britain at war

By September 1914 the German army had reached the River Marne in France, where a great battle stopped the German advance at the cost of many lives. When the British Secretary of State for War, Lord Kitchener, realised that the war was going to last a long time and that Britain would have to send a large army overseas, he appealed for volunteers, but it would take time to turn them into soldiers. Britain relied on these volunteers until 1916. The Empire made its contribution sending troops from the dominions as well as volunteers from Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Conscription was introduced in Britain in 1916. Women replaced men in their civilian jobs with reliability and competence, which contributed to bringing about women's suffrage.

#### The Easter Rising in Ireland

A major issue of British politics in the first two decades of the 20th century was the Irish Question. The term refers to the tragic events regarding the fight for Irish independence. In April 1916 there was a rebellion in Dublin, the so-called Easter Rising, due to the fact that Home Rule, voted by the Commons in 1914, had been suspended until the end of the war. The leaders of the insurrection received support from Germany and seized the General Post Office and other buildings in the centre of the city. The rebellion was repressed and 15 of the leaders executed. The Irish Republican party Sinn Féin (an Irish name meaning ourselves alone'), which was fighting for the reunification of Ireland, began to grow in popularity exploiting the fear the Irish had that military conscription might extend to Ireland.

#### A war of attrition

In May 1915 a German submarine sank the British passenger liner Lusitania and more than a thousand people died, including 128 Americans. The US President Thomas Woodrow Wilson (1913-21) sent diplomatic protests to Germany. In the same month Italy joined France and Britain, and the German Zeppelin airship carried out the first aerial bombing of London.
The bloodiest battle in British history took place on the Somme, in northern France, in July 1916. The Somme was a perfect example of the war of attrition, where huge battles were fought not to win strategic objectives or seize resources, but to kill soldiers and wear down the enemy. Soldiers retreated into trenches behind barbed wire; machine guns, poison gas, tanks and aircraft were used. The Germans also relied on submarines, called U-boats, to fight the war at sea. These submarines were effective in sinking warships and the merchant ships carrying important supplies from the USA. Life in the trenches was very stressful because of mud, lack of hygiene, boredom and fear of gas. So the soldiers relieved the stress means of superstition, religion, poetry, letters and drink. 'Shell shock was the term used by doctors to allude to the psychological effect of shell explosions, blamed for the frequent cases of psychological disorders among soldiers. The horror of trench life was recalled by the War Poets. Domestic and international stress reached its climax in the late 1917 and early 1918: in July 1917 George V changed the name of the British royal family from the German Saxe-Coburg-Gotha into the British Windsor; the Bolsheviks seized power in Russia and the Italian army collapsed at the Battle of Caporetto in October 1917. The Austrians had mass surrenders and desertions, Germany was starving. The United States joined the war in April 1917 on Britain's side.

#### The end of the war

In September 1918 British artillery began dropping shells on the Hindenburg Line, a series of German trenches believed to be impenetrable, while tanks and infantry attacked on the ground. By October the Germans were retreating along the Western Front. Warfare cost the Allies and the Germans about 260,000 casualties respectively. On 4th October 1918 Germany asked President Woodrow Wilson for an armistice which would bring about German withdrawal from occupied territory and allow national self-determination, but included no punishment for the country Britain and France agreed for fear that American power might increase if war continued. On 11th November, at 11 o'clock, the guns fell silent and the day has forever been commemorated as Armistice Day. It was also called 'Remembrance Day' or Poppy Day as, once the war was over, the poppy was one of the only plants to grow on the battlefields. The peace treaty was signed at Versailles in 1919 by the Allied powers. It stipulated the Allied occupation of the Rhineland, unilateral disarmament and heavy financial reparation of 'war guilt for Germany. President Woodrow Wilson proposed 'Fourteen Points' to work out the peace treaty and prevent future wars. He presented a plan to set up the League of Nations. This was to be an international organisation, with its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, and was to act as a forum for resolving international disputes. However, it proved very difficult to create, and Wilson left office without managing to convince the USA to join. The League of Nations was the forerunner of the United Nations.

## Inter-war years

#### Towards independence

The effort the dominions of the British Empire had made during the war created expectations of reward. In 1926 an imperial conference created a new entity from the dominions of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa with the name of 'Commonwealth. In 1931 the Statute of Westminster formally granted the sovereign right of each dominion to control its own domestic and foreign affairs and to establish its own diplomatic corps. India suffered regional and religious tensions accompanied by rising support for the Nationalist Congress Party. Steps towards self-government were being taken, under the pressure from Mohandas Gandhi's (1869-1948) non-cooperation movement, whose popular campaigns undermined the deference to British authority on which imperial rule depended. The Government of India Act in 1935 established self-government at a provincial level in the hope of maintaining Britain's control of the country as a whole.

#### The Irish War of Independence

In the 1918 election in Ireland, the Sinn Féin party won almost all the seats except in the province of Ulster, but instead of going to Westminster, it set up an independent Parliament in Dublin - the Dáil - in 1919. The Irish Volunteers, a militant nationalist organisation founded in 1913, became the IRA (Irish Republican Army) and they declared open war on Britain in 1920, under the leadership of Michael Collins (1890 - 1922). The IRA terrorist attacks were brutally met by Black and Tan' police auxiliaries, culminating with 'Bloody Sunday' in 1920, when the 'Black and Tans' shot 12 dead at a football match in Dublin.
In 1921 an Anglo-Irish treaty established the Irish Free State, under the leadership of Eamon de Valera (1882-1975), as an independent State within the British Commonwealth. Only six counties centered on Protestant Ulster remained a self-governing province of the United Kingdom. In 1922 a civil war broke out in Ireland between those who accepted the Anglo-Irish Treaty and those who were against it. In 1923 the anti-Treaty faction, who wanted the inclusion of the six counties of Ulster in the Republican Ireland, was defeated.

#### The aftermath of WWI

The aftermath of World War I was marked by a world economic boom. A house-building programme started in Britain and there were improvements in public health; 40% of the population was covered by medical insurance. There was a boom in the sales of the daily press, Newspapers, which had been almost the only means of mass communication before the First World War, were supplemented in the 1920s by the development of radio broadcasting. In 1927 the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) was created.

However, the Wall Street Crash of 1929 dramatically affected life between the wars, since in the following year banks went bankrupt across Europe. The war had damaged Britain's position as the biggest exporter of manufactured goods because production had been turned to the war effort. Therefore, British customers had found new suppliers in South America and Asia. Working hours were cut, prices fell but the attempt to cut wages was resisted by the trade unions. There were miners' strikes and a General Strike was called in 1926. The most urgent inter-war issue was unemployment and the gap between North and South took on a new dimension: the once powerful industrial North became depressed and challenged by new growing automobile, chemical and electrical goods industries in the South and the Midlands, Restoring demand to the iron and steel industries began with rearmament in 1936.

#### The difficult 1930s

From 1935, Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin (1923-37) led a Conservative government which was opposed to another war. He had to make controversial decisions regarding the abdication crisis of 1936 and rearmament. The popular young king, Edward VIII, who had succeeded his father George V, wanted to marry a twice divorced American woman. Baldwin forced his abdication on the grounds that he could not marry her and keep the throne. The king's brother succeeded as George VI (1936-52). As for rearmament, the need for a strong Royal Air Force (RAF) independent of the army and the navy led the British government to shift spending onto the RAF. At the same time a ship-building programme was funded aimed at a 'two-ocean fleet'.

#### Towards World War II

In 1935 the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini (1883-1945) attacked the African monarchy of Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and took the first steps towards an alliance with Germany, where Adolf Hitler (1889-1945) and his Nazi Party had come to power in 1933. Hitler sent troops illegally into the Rhineland in 1936. In the same year a three-year long civil war started in Spain between Nationalists and Republicans. A crisis also began in the East with a Japanese attack on China in 1937.
Hitler invaded Austria in 1938 proclaiming its union with Germany and breaking the Treaty of Versailles. In November 1938 Kristallnacht, organised violence against Jewish people and property in Germany took place, followed by the occupation of Prague in March 1939. In August Hitler signed the secret Molotov Ribbentrop non-aggression pact with Stalin (1879-1953) and on 1st September he invaded Poland. Two days later Britain and France declared war on Germany.

## The Second World War

#### The beginning of the war

When war began in 1939, in Britain evacuation schemes were organised to move people, especially children, from the towns and cities; hospital patients were sent home to release beds; the paintings of the National Gallery were stored in mines in North Wales and underground stations soon became shelters for civilians during night-time raids. The United Kingdom sent British troops to aid in the defence of France.

In April 1940 Hitler invaded Norway and Denmark by sea and air, because about a third of Germany's iron ore supply came from Scandinavia. In May there was a sudden German attack on Holland and Belgium, while German tank corps were heading for Paris. British Prime Minister Chamberlain (1937-40) resigned in 1940 and Sir Winston Churchill took over (1940-45). The British ordered the retreat of their troops to Dunkirk, where they had to be lifted from the beaches by Royal Navy ships and private boats whose owners volunteered to bring back our boys Meanwhile Japan overran Hong Kong and Burma (now Myanmar) and began to threaten Singapore and India. America kept aloof despite Churchill's constant appeals for help.

#### Operation Sea Lion

Hitler was planning the invasion of Britain, Operation Sea Lion. The Luftwaffe, the German air force, had to put Britain's defence in the Southeast out of action, in order to open the way for the sea invasion. In 1940 the Battle of Britain saw English and German bombers fighting in the skies over Sussex and Kent. The battle was won by Britain, but Hitler changed his strategy and ordered the 'Blitz, an intense bombing of civilian targets in London and other cities, with the aim of weakening the enemy. King George VI and his wife Elizabeth refused to leave London and remained in Buckingham Palace, becoming symbols of resistance. In spite of the devastation and the deaths of thousands of civilians, the British people did not fall into submission.

#### Operation Barbarossa

In 1941 German forces advanced south and east, and in Africa General Rommel forced the British army to retreat. In June Hitler decided to declare war on the Soviet Union because he wanted to get the oilfields in the Caucasus region. The so-called 'Operation Barbarossa was the largest military operation in history and would consume Germany's resources for the rest of the war.

#### America joined the war

In December 1941 Japan bombed the US fleet in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. President Franklin D. Roosevelt (1932-45) declared war on Japan, and Germany declared war on America. The Japanese quickly advanced in the Far East. In 1942, with the Battle of Midway Island, the US fleet sank four Japanese aircraft carriers, weakening the Japanese position in the Pacific. In November 1942 General Montgomery defeated Rommel at El-Alamein, thus preventing the fall of Egypt. In July 1943 the Allies landed in Sicily led by General George Patton, and a long fight up Italian territory began. Germany's advance eastward was stopped by their defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad, where the Soviet forces surrounded and crushed an entire German army. This was a turning point in the war. The Allies continued to score victories against the Germans, also helped by the science of sonar, radar and the Enigma code-breaking computer. In the summer of 1944 the Allies entered Rome and decided to open a western front in France.

#### Operation Overlord

The greatest amphibious force in history arrived on the beaches of Normandy on 6th June 1944, also known as D-Day. The Germans retreated across France and counter-attacked at the Battle of the Bulge in the Belgian Ardennes in December 1944. General Patton's forces played a key role in defeating the German counter-attack, after which they went across the Rhine River and into Germany.

#### The end of the war

The Soviet Red Army was slowly advancing, liberating Poland, Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Austria and the eastern fringes of Germany. On 30th April 1945 Hitler committed suicide, and Berlin fell on 2nd May. At the Yalta Conference in Crimea in February 1945, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill and Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin made important decisions concerning the future progress of the war and the post-war world. The war ended in Europe on 8th May 1945 but it took another three months to defeat Japan in the Far East. Victory came only with the explosion of two atomic bombs on the Japanese towns of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6th and 9th August. The atomic bombing ended World War II and began a new age.

## USA
### Progressivism

**Progressivism**
It’s a new policy adopted by US by Theodore Roosevelt, based on a series of reforms on the social and economic spheres.

The position of the US during WWI was at the beginning of not intervening; they only took part in 1917: this allowed to US to gain economic superiority, since the costs of the war were different from the others countries.
In Fact in the end of the Great War US was one of the richest country of the world: this period will be called the Roaring Twenties, whose main characteristics are:
* There was an economic boom
* Red Scare: was the fear of socialism spread through US; a lot of political activist were seen as Communists sympathiser, and they were killed.
* Prohibition: It’s referred to a ban of the government, about production, importation and distribution of alcohol; there was a problem of alcohol addiction among the poor. This led to an illegal market of alcohol.
* Feeling of xenofobia spread among the people; previously the us followed an open door policy, but now we have a different approach with a series of restrictions on immigration, with the segregation of minority.

The economic boom of the twenties led to an excessive speculation, which led to the Wall Street crash of the 1929: it produced an strong economic crisis all around the world.

There was also an environmental disaster, the so called Dust Bowl, which is used to refer to a series of dust stores that took place in soma place in the us, following a period of drought.

After this period of crisis there was the period of the **New Deal**: it’s a series of reforms by Franklin Roosevelt: based on **Relief**, **Recovey** and **Reform**
1. Relief is related to the poor
2. Recovery of the economy
3. Reform of the financial system in order to prevent future crisis

### WWII

American factories received a new impulse from the Second World War. At first the United States maintained neutrality, following its policy of **isolationism**, but it joined the conflict in 1941. All resources were organised towards winning the war, including two thousand million dollars spent on the Manhattan Project, a research project to produce and test the first atomic bomb. Among the scientists working in the nuclear field was the Italian physicist Enrico Fermi (1901-54). The main assembly plant was built at Los Alamos, New Mexico.

After the WWII the USA emerged as one of the superpowers together with Russia.
