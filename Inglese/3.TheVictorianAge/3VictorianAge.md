# The Victorian Age
==p. 405 - IV==

> It was the best of time, it was the worst of times. It was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity. It was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair
>
>— Charles Dickens, The Tale of Two Cities

It was an age of contradiction and opposites: age of progress, but also of problems in justice.

The Victorian Age usually is meant from 1837 - 1901, during the reign of Queen Victoria. Actually the Victorian Age started in 1832, with the _Great Reform Bill_, a law, which is usually taken as the watershed between the romantic age and the victorian age.
This Reform Bill shifted political power from the hands of the landowners to the hands of manufacturer. It implied cultural changes as well.

## Social area
The new ruling classes were as ruthless as those that had governed Britain during the first phase of industrial revolution, but they began to be gradually aware of the inhuman levels of exploitation of the workers: they were more careful on the workers:
* at a political level this awareness gave rise to a serious of reforms that in the end improved the conditions of life and work of the proletarians, avoiding at the same time that social revolution that, according to Marx’s analysis, should have taken place in Britain first;
* among the common affluent people this awareness took the form of humanitarianism, philanthropy and sentimentalism;
* the Victorian novelist, mostly belonging to the middle classes, shared the same values and models of life of their reading public, and approached with this attitude to the main problems of their times; they felt a sense of guilt, and they find a solution in philanthropy, and they acted according to philanthropy granted from a position of social and economic privilege; at the same time they thought that their only responsibility was to expose their problems
* there were some _good points_:
  1. more general **prosperity** that was spreading in Britain;
  2. medical, mechanical and scientific **progress**;
  3. improvement of **literacy**
  4. the reform of a **middle class parliament**, conceded to the working classes, created a widespread belief that social peace was possible and that progress was limitless
  * these good points account for the optimism which characterized the whole period, and for the self-confidence and self-complacency of the middle classes which were alse able to impose their values on the working class; the most important value was _respectability_
* the _negative points_ are:
  1. **poverty**
  2. **prostitution**
  3. **exploitation of labour**
  4. **cruelty to children**
  * these evils were removed from the conscience of people by being concealed under the veil of hypocrisy;
  * it was a characteristic tendency of the victorian society to deceive itself in relation to its responsibilities and faults; some political writers exposed this attitude, attacking the fundamental insensitivity of their times

---

The Victorian Age was a very complex age, marked by religious, social and political unrest and confusion.

The country underwent a gradual but continuous process of democratisation, and greater freedom was given to catholics

The class that benefited most from the changes of the time was the middle class, which was made up of manufactures, merchants and bankers.
This class increased in power, and took the control of the Government. This class was also favoured by progress in industrial and technological field.

This situation led to widespread optimism, due to colonial expansion, scientific and technical results, and improvement in transports.
Middle class people believe that _happines_ could be reached **through technical progress**.

The Victorians were proud of their **welfare**, of their good manners, of their middle class values, and tended to ignore the social problems that still afflicted most of the population.
The working class lived in misery and distress. The new hurbans conditions, and the growth of slums have created a lot of health problems.
Whole families were often crowded in a single room, where lack of hygiene, occasionally led to cholera.

The government create the **work houses**, in order to solve these problems.
They were institutions built by government and run by parishes, where families who couldn’t support themselves were confined. Here sexes were segregated and people were barely fed. People were always hungry and dirty and miserable.

The reason why the work houses were built was the poverty, whether it was the result of bad behaviour or bad luck, was virtually regarded as a crime, and it was penalised as such. This was the mentality for which workhouses were created.
Also debtors were held in work houses, or at least in jail.

Also education had his problems, because teachers were often incompetent, but they controlled the students through corporal punishment.

This particular situation which saw prosperity and progress on the one hand, and poverty, ugliness and injustice on the other, which opposed conformism to corruption, moralism and philanthropy to money and capitalistic greediness, and which separated private life from public behaviour, was called **Victorian Compromise**.

The situation nevertheless aroused the concern of many and many reformers and theorists, who, for social or humanitarian reasons, tried to improve living conditions of the poor, at all levels, including hospitals, schools and prisons.
It is thanks to their care and actions that parliament passed so many acts regulating work, sanitation, the condition of children, the exploitation of teenagers.

### Evangelicalism
A religious movement that acted in this period was **Evangelicalism**; it was inspired by the teachings of John Wesley, the founder of **Methodism**.
The evangelicals were deeply concerned with _human problems_ and _social reforms_. They contributed to the _abolition of slavery_ and the _First Reform Bill_.
They had a puritanical view of life, so they advocate
* the abolition of certain public entertainments,
* a strict observance of Sunday
* very strict code of behavior.

### Bentham’s Utilitarianism
==p. 12 - V==

According to Utilitarianism, an action is morally right if it has consequences that lead to happiness, and wrong if it brings about the reverse. Therefore all institutions should be tested in the light of reason and common sense to determine whether they are useful, measuring the extent to which they provide for the material happiness of the greatest number of people.
Utilitarianism suited the interests of the middle class and contributed to the Victorian conviction that any problem could be overcome through reason.

### Fabian Society
It was in this particular atmosphere that the **Fabian Society** was founded in 1884, by Sidney and Beatrice Webbs. It was inspired by Marxist doctrines, and it consists in **socialists** who advocated gradual reforms instead of drastic revolutionary measures.
Its name derived from _Quintus Fabius Maximus_, which was a general called “the delayer”, because in his campagne against Annibale avoided direct engagement.

### Respectability
Manners underwent a deep change in this period; under the influence of Queen Victoria herself the age became excessively **puritan**; sex became a taboo subject, and all the words with sexual connotation were replaced by synonyms.

The key word in this period was ==**respectability**==

#### Victorian Family
The conventional morality of the time found its best expression within the family, where the father was the _authority_ and the mother was to be _submissive_ and _fruitful_. In fact Victorian Families were usually very large, also because Queen Victoria herself had 9 children.

Middle class women were expected to be _frail_, _innocent_ and _pure_. They were confined within the family. They were devoted to _respectable jobs_ like teaching.

But restrictions involved men too; they were forbidden to gamble, swear and drink hard.

Clothes were very formal because appearance was very important.

#### The Victorian House
Victorian people were busy with making money and social climbing, so they had little time for art, and this indifference led to bad taste in buildings and furnishings.
These needed to be a status symbols, and so houses became pretentious, but _not beautiful_.  The interiors were overcrowded with _ornaments_, _decorations_ and _furniture_.

## Challenges from the scientific field
==p. 13 - V==

In his work _On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection_ Charle Darwin presented his theory of evolution and natural selection. He later developed it in his work _The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex_.
According to Darwin’s theory:
* all living creatures in existence have developed their forms through a slow process of change and adaptation in a struggle for survival;
* favorable physical conditions determine the survival of a species, unfavorable ones its extinction ;
* man evolved, like any other animal, from a less highly organized form, namely a monkey.

On the one hand, Darwin’s theory discarded the version of creation given by the Bible; on the other hand, it seemed to show that the universe was not static but perpetually developing, that the strongest survived and the weakest deserved to be defeated.

### The Oxford Movement
==p. 13 - V==

British Catholics replied to the challenges of science by returning to the ancient doctrines and rituals. The religious revival found its expression in the movement headed by the English cardinal John Henry Newman, which went under the name of “Oxford Movement” because it began at Oxford University.

## Queen Victoria
She belongs to the Hanoverians (George I, George II, William IV). She was the niece of William IV, and she took the throne when she was only **18 yo**, and she would reign for 64 years and she would became a symbol of the entire age.

## Reforms

When Victoria got to the throne she found a Country in difficult conditions, because there was discontent among the working classes, due to a period of _economical crisis_.
### Chartist Movement
A direct consequence of this economical crisis was the birth of the **Chartist Movement**: their name went from their proposal of a charter of reforms, made up of 6 points:
1. _universal suffrage_
2. _annual parliament_
3. _payment for parliament member_; so far the member of parliament were not paid, so only rich people could afford to stay there
4. the _right for a man without proprieties to be elected_
5. _secret ballot_
6. _equal electoral districts_; until that moment the electoral districts were of the same area and dimensions, without taking care of the density of population; in this way it was very easy for affluent people to control districts with a small number of people (called _rotten boroughs_)

This petition was not accepted in parliament, and so Chartist disappeared from policy in 1848, since they were considered politically immature, and their projects were doomed to failure, but with the passing of time all their reforms had been actuated, but for the _annual parliament_.

### Parties and politics

In 1825 the ==**Trade Unions**== [sindacati] were legalized, and they became stronger and stronger. In 1868 there was the first Trade Union Congress, and a status was given to the movement.

The long reign of queen Victoria saw a succession of great Prime Ministers, some belonging to the Tories (now conservatives), and some belonging to the Wigs (now liberals; in the modern parliament is the Labour to oppose to Conservative, born in 1906).
The two parties, that were ==**Tories and Wigs**==, had different opinions, but they agreed for a second and a third _Reform Bill_.
* The **Second Reform Bill** was passed in 1867, and it extended the right of vote to Town Labourers, while peasants and miners couldn’t vote.
* Only with the **Third Reform Bill**, in 1884, that the latter were given a right to vote. In this way the number of electors doubled, since suffrage had been extended to all male workers

It only refers, obviously, to men. _Women couldn’t vote_

Many representatives of the working class may now be elected, entering the _house of commons_.

In 1897 the **independent Labour party** was formed (born as a movement), and finally the working class may compete widely for politically power. They were transformed into a real party in 1900, and had a great political success in 1906.

### Economical reforms

An other social question was the ==price of **corn**==; it was kept artificially high by the government, through protective tariffs there were called the _Corn laws_, which restricted the importation of foreign corn.
An association was formed against the Corn laws, and it obtained the repeal [cancellazione] of these laws in 1846, with the support of a conservative Prime Minister, Peel.
The repeal caused much discontent in the _Conservative Party_, since it wanted to protect the interests of the _landed gentry_, by which it was largely supported.

The upper class and the industrial class both believed in a policy of ==**Free Trade**==, that is an uncontrolled flow of commercial transactions with foreign nations. It was a free exchange of good, without protective tariffs, and it brought great wealth to England.

### Other reforms

The Victorian Age was marked by a great number of social achievements and reforms;
* **The Factory Act**, which regulated and improved the conditions of workers in factory
* **Ten Hours’ Act**, which limited the working hours to ten a day, for both men and women.
* **The Mines Act**, which prohibited the working of women and children in mines
* **The Public Health Act**, which improved health condition
* **The Education Act**, which reorganized elementary education
* **Adoption of the English week**, by which Saturday Afternoon was devoted to pleasure and entertainment


## Foreign Policy

### Ireland
The population of Ireland consisted mainly of Catholics, and they were very poor and they became even poorer by recurrent famines; with only potato crops to feed on.
In the 1840’s there was a potato famine, and so potato crops failed several times; this caused mass starvation and emigration.
In order to stop a mass emigration and starvation, Charles Parnell, which was an irish leader, demanded Home Rule (an independent constitution), but these reforms were rejected twice by the conservatives, and Ireland obtained Home Rule only after WWI.

### British Colonial Empire
The Victorian Age was above all the period in which the great British Colonial Empire took its final form.

There was an enlargement of the indian territories, as a consequence of the indian mutiny [ammutinamento indiano] in 1857, and after this mutiny England acquired the control of India. In 1876, Queen Victoria became Empress of India, that was India, Bangladesh and Pakistan.

The English Empire had enormous proportions, involving Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, Ceylon, Singapore, Hong Kong, Gibraltar, Malta and Cyprus.

This period is characterized by two wars:
* from 1899 to 1902 England was at war against two south-african areas, called Orange and Transvaal; these two areas were interesting because there were diamonds and gold; these two regions were ruled by dutch colonists, called Boers; it gave England the supremacy over the two dutch reasons
* **The Crimean War**: it was the only international’s war during Victoria’s Reign; it was originated by a dispute between Turkey and Russia, over the boundaries of the Turkish empire.; England and France, declared war on Russia, together with Turkey, because they were afraid of the growing power of Russia in the balkans; the war broke out in 1854 and 1857; Russia was defeated, but the conflict exposed the disorganization of the English Army particularly in the field of sanitation; public opinion was horrified at the news to the terrible conditions in which sick and wounded soldiers were kept; a young lady of noble origins, **Florence Nightingale** went to Crimea organized hospitals, obtained nurses medicines and bandages from England, laid the foundations of Medical Services for soldiers; she inspired the creation of the Women’s Corps in the international _Red Cross_.

## Victorian Poetry
==p. 22 - V==

During Victoria’s Reign poetry became more concerned with social reality.
This led on the one hand to the creation of majestic poetry linked to the myth and the belief of the greatness of England; on the other hand to the creation of poetry more inclined towards anti-myth and disbelief which had to solve the ethical problems raised by science and progress

Now the poet was seen as a “prophet” and a “philosopher”. People expected that he could reconcile faith and progress, as well as sprinkle a little romance over the unromantic materialism of modern life.

The major poets of the age were **Alfred Tennyson** and **Robert Browning**.

Victorian Poetry started as a revival of Romanticism but soon mirrored the sense of uneasiness that characterized the Victorian Age.
The most important poets were **Alfred Tennyson** and **Robert Browning** and they felt a moral responsibility through their poems towards their public.

## The later years of Queen Victoria

#### The Liberal and Conservative Parties {ignore=true}

When Prince Albert tragically died from typhoid in 1861, Queen Victoria withdrew from society and spent the next ten years in mourning. She still remained an important figure even though the political panorama was changing with the regrouping of the parties. The Liberal Party, as it was called from the 1860s, included the former Whigs, some Radicals and a large minority of businessmen; the party was led by William Gladstone (1809 98). The Conservative Party, which had evolved from the Tories in the 1830s, reaffirmed its position under the leadership of Benjamin Disraeli (1804-81).

#### Benjamin Disraeli {ignore=true}

Disraeli briefly became Prime

Minister in 1868 and regained the office after the elections in 1874. In his second term, his government passed an Artisans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act (1875), which allowed local public authorities to clear the slums and provided housing for the poor; a Public Health Act (1875), which provided sanitation as well as running water; and a Factory Act (1878), which limited the working hours per week. Disraeli's foreign policy was dominated by the Eastern Question, that is, the decay of the Ottoman Empire and the attempt by other European countries, such as Russia, to gain power there. In 1875 Disraeli encouraged the purchase of more shares in the Suez Canal Company to protect Britain's route to the East.

#### William Gladstone {ignore=true}

Gladstone was Prime Minister four times, starting in 1868. At that time, reforming legislation focused on education. Elementary schools had long been organised by the Church; the 1870 Education Act started a national system by introducing 'board schools, mainly in the poorer areas of the towns. By 1880 elementary education had become compulsory. Other reforms included the legalisation of trade unions in 1871, with the Trade Union Act, and the introduction of the secret ballot at elections in 1872, with the Ballot Act.
Gladstone was re-elected three times (1880, 1886, 1892). The Third Reform Act of 1884 extended voting to all male householders, including miners, mill-workers and farm labourers. This extension of the franchise gave public opinion an important role as a political force.
The Irish Parliamentary Party, sitting as a group in Westminster and led by Charles Stewart Parnell (1846-91), demanded self-government for Ireland - the so-called 'Home Rule. Gladstone believed that Home Rule was the way to bring peace to Ireland and tried to get Parliament to pass a bill three times; but an Irish government was granted only after World War I.

#### The Anglo-Boer Wars {ignore=true}

The struggle with France at the beginning of the 19th century had led to Britain's global hegemony - with its naval power and its enormous financial and economic strength, Britain seemed invulnerable. However, since Waterloo, its foreign policy had been defensive. Many areas of the world were characterised by political and cultural fragmentation and it was there that Britain began to gain control without major political intervention. This was the situation in South America, in Asia and most of all in Africa, where Britain competed with the other European countries to divide up the continent. In South Africa, by the 1870s, the British controlled two colonies, Cape Colony and Natal, while the Dutch settlers, the Boers, had the two republics of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. When Britain took over Transvaal in 1877, the Boers rebelled and war broke out. The Boer Wars (1880-1902) ended in 1902 with a British victory.

#### Empress of India {ignore=true}

In 1877 Queen Victoria was given a new title, Empress of India. In the last decades of the 19th century, the British Empire occupied an area of 4 million square miles and more than 400 million people were ruled over by the British. The Empire, however, was becoming more difficult to control. There was a growing sense of the white man's burden, a difficult combination of the duty to spread Christian civilisation, encouraging toleration and open communication and at the same time promoting commercial interests. It was a strongly felt obligation to provide leadership where States were failing or non existent, especially in Africa and India. India was economically important as a market for British goods and strategically necessary to British control of Asia from the Persian Gulf to Shanghai. By 1850 the East India Company directly ruled most of northern, central and south-eastern India. In the late Victorian period the new imperial government became more ambitious and through free market economics it destroyed traditional farming and caused the deindustrialisation of India. At one time the main manufacturer of cotton cloth for the world, India, now became the largest importer of England's cotton.

#### The end of an era {ignore=true}

The Victorian Age came to an end with the death of Queen Victoria in 1901. For almost a century she had embodied decorum, stability and continuity. Her Golden and Diamond Jubilees for 50 and 60 years on the throne had been celebrated with huge public parades, and for her funeral London streets were packed with mourners. She was buried beside her beloved husband in the Frogmore mausoleum at Windsor Castle.

## The late Victorians

#### Victorian urban society and women {ignore=true}

In the later years of Victoria's reign, Britain was primarily an urban society. Victorian cities had gas lighting, rubbish collection and there were many public buildings, such as town halls, railway stations, libraries and museums, music halls, boarding schools and hospitals, police stations and prisons. This was a period of a retail consumer boom - with many new shops, public houses and theatres. Even now some Victorian institutions can still be seen in British cities.

Middle-class women became increasingly involved in public life as leaders in campaigns against prostitution, as teachers and as volunteer charitable workers. Further education opportunities for women became available with the opening of women's colleges in the 1870s. However, a strong taboo remained regarding family issues such as control over property, conditions of divorce and rights over children as well as questions of sex and childbirth. The 1882 Married Women's Property Act gave married women the right to own and manage their own property independently of their husbands for the first time.

#### Social Darwinism {ignore=true}

Darwin's theory of evolution became the foundation for various ethical and social systems, such as Social Darwinism, which developed in the 1870s. The philosopher Herbert Spencer (1820-1903) applied Darwin's theory of natural selection to human society: he argued that races, nations and social classes, like biological species, were subject to the principle of the survival of the fittest and that the poor and oppressed did not deserve compassion.

Eugenics was a similar interpretation created by Darwin's cousin, Sir Francis Galton (1822 1911), and attracting many intellectuals. They exhorted the middle classes, regarded as nature's fittest, to reproduce more, especially educated women who seemed to neglect their racial duty to breed.

#### Late Victorian thinkers {ignore=true}

In the second half of the 19th century, Britain reached the peak of its power abroad; however. some ideological conflicts were beginning to undermine the self-confident attitude that had characterised the first part of Victoria's reign. Changes regarded several fields, especially scientific achievements, industrialisation. sexuality and religion, and a growing pessimism began to affect intellectuals and artists, who expressed in different ways their sense of doubt about the stability of Victorian society. Among the thinkers of the late Victorian period, a significant role was played by those who protested against the harm caused by industrialism in man's life and in the environment. Karl Marx (1818-83) based the theories he expressed in his treatise in three volumes Das Kapital (1867, 1885, 1894) upon research done in England, the most advanced European industrial nation of the time, His works influenced some English writers like the art critic John Ruskin (1819-1900)and the artist William Morris (1834-96). They were looking for a different form of progress, a blend of utopianism and nostalgia in which the future in many ways resembled the past. While studying at Oxford in the 1850s, William Morris drew inspiration from Ruskin's works on Gothic architecture and his criticism of the inhumanity of industrialisation, and from Thomas Malory's medieval romance Le Morte d'Arthur. Together with the Pre Raphaelite painters, he started a battle against the age he was living in. He set up a firm to produce craft-made furniture, wallpaper and other decorative objects as a reaction to utilitarian mass-produced goods. In 1883 he became a militant in the Social Democratic Federation.

#### The spread of socialists ideas {ignore=true}

The 1880s saw the rise of an organised political left after the foundation of the Fabian Society in 1884. It was a middle-class socialist group whose members aimed at transforming Britain into a socialist State not through revolution, as Marx advised, but by systematic, progressive reforms. Its early members included Sidney and Beatrice Webb and George Bernard Shaw. The Independent Labour Party was set up in 1893; it was a non-Marxist socialist party which attracted both male and female intellectuals. Various socialist groups were joined by young skilled workers and intellectuals who read John Ruskin's criticism of the greed, competition and ugliness of industrial society.

#### Patriotism {ignore=true}

In the late 19th century, expressions of civic pride and national fervour were frequent among the British. Patriotism was deeply influenced by ideas of racial superiority.
Towards the end of Victoria's reign the British considered themselves the leaders of European civilisation. There was a belief that the 'races' of the world were divided by fundamental physical and intellectual differences, that some were destined to be led by others. It was thus an obligation imposed by God on the British to spread their superior way of life, their institutions, law and political system on native peoples throughout the world. This attitude came to be known as Jingoism. Colonial power and economic progress made for the optimistic outlook of many Victorians.

## The Victorian Novel

#### Readers and writers {ignore=true}

During the Victorian Age, for the first time, there was a communion of interests and opinions between writers and their readers. One reason for this close relationship was the enormous growth of the middle classes. Although its members belonged to many different levels where literacy had penetrated in a heterogeneous way, they were avid consumers of literature. They borrowed books from circulating libraries and read the abundant variety of periodicals. Moreover, Victorian writers themselves often belonged to the middle class.

#### The publishing word {ignore=true}

A great deal of Victorian literature was first published in a serial form. Essays, verse and even novels made their first appearance in instalments in the pages of periodicals. This allowed the writer to feel he was in constant contact with his public. He was obliged to maintain the interest of his story gripping because one boring instalment would cause the public not to buy that periodical any longer. There was a further advantage because an author could always alter the story, according to its success or failure. Reviewers also had a strong influence on the reception of literary works and on the shaping of public opinion.

#### The Victorians' interest in prose {ignore=true}

The Victorians showed a marked interest in prose, and the greatest literary achievement of the age is to be found in the novel, which soon became the most popular form of literature and the main source of entertainment. The spread of scientific knowledge made the novel realistic and analytical, the spread of democracy made it social and humanitarian, while the spirit of moral unrest made it inquisitive and critical.

#### The novelist's aim {ignore=true}

During the 18th century, novels generally dealt with the adventures either of a social outcast or a more virtuous hero, but their episodic structure remained the same. The idea of a thematic unity was brought in by Jane Austen, with the theme of a girl's choice of a husband, and by the Gothic writers who set their novels in a remote, at times strange and exotic, past. In the 1840s novelists felt they had a moral and social responsibility to fulfill. They wanted to reflect the social changes that had been in progress for a long time, such as the Industrial Revolution, the struggle for democracy and the growth of towns and cities. The novelists of the first part of the Victorian period described society as they saw it, and, with the exception of those sentiments which offended current morals, particularly regarding sex, nothing escaped their scrutiny. They were aware of the evils of their society, such as the terrible conditions of manual workers and the exploitation of children. However, their criticism was much less radical than that of contemporary European writers, like Balzac, Flaubert, Turgenev and Dostoyevsky, because the historical conditions of Britain were quite different from those of France or Russia.
Didacticism was one of the main features of Victorian novels, because novelists also conceived literature as a vehicle to correct the vices and weaknesses of the age.

#### The narrative technique {ignore=true}

The voice of the omniscient narrator provided a comment on the plot and erected a rigid barrier between 'right' and 'wrong' behaviours, light and darkness. Retribution and punishment were to be found in the final chapter of the novel, where the whole texture of events, adventures and incidents had to be explained and justified

#### Setting and characters {ignore=true}

The setting chosen by most Victorian novelists was the city, which was the main symbol of the industrial civilisation as well as the expression of anonymous lives and lost identities.
In their effort to portray the individual motives for human action and all that binds men and women to the community, Victorian writers concentrated on the creation of realistic characters the public could easily identify with, in terms of comedy - especially Dickens's characters - or dramatic passion the Brontë sisters' heroines.

#### Types of novels {ignore=true}

* **The novel of manners**. It kept close to the original 19th-century models. It dealt with economic and social problems and described a particular class or situation. A master of this genre was William M. Thackeray.
* **The humanitarian novel**. Charles Dickens's novels are mostly admired for their tone, combining humour with a sentimental request for reform for the less fortunate. They constitute the bulk of what is generally called the 'humanitarian noveľ or the 'novel of purpose, which could be divided into novels of a realistic, fantastic' or 'moral nature according to their predominant tone or issue dealt with.
* **The novel of formation**. The _Bildungsroman_ (novel of formation or education) became very popular after the publication of Charlotte Brontë's _Jane Eyre_ and Dickens's _David Copperfield_. These novels dealt with one character's development from early youth to some sort of maturity. The works by the Brontë sisters can be linked to the persistence of the Romantic and Gothic traditions; they focus on intense subjective experiences rather than on a world of social interaction.
* **Literary nonsense**. A particular aspect of Victorian literature is what is called 'nonsense, created by Edward Lear (1812-88) and Lewis Carroll. In his famous novel _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_ (1865), Carroll created a nonsensical universe where the social rules and conventions are disintegrated, the cause-effect relationship does not exist, and time and space have lost their function of giving an order to human experience.

#### Women writers {ignore=true}

It is important to underline that a great number of novels published during the mid-Victorian period, up to 1870-80, were written by women such as Charlotte and Emily Brontë and George Eliot (the pen name of Mary Ann Evans). This output is surprising considering the state of subjection of Victorian women. It is less surprising if one remembers that the majority of novel-buyers and readers were women. Middle-class women had more time to spend at home than men and could devote part of the day to reading. However, it was not easy to get published, and some women used a male pseudonym in order to see their work in print. Creative writing, like art and other public activities, was considered 'masculine'. From Jane Austen to George Eliot, the woman's novel had moved in the direction of a realistic exploration of the daily lives and values of women within the family and the community

## Aestheticism and Decadence

#### The birth of the Aesthetic Movement {ignore=true}

The Aesthetic Movement developed in the universities and intellectual circles in the last decades of the 19th century. It began in France with Théophile Gautier (1811-72) and reflected the sense of frustration and uncertainty of the artist, his reaction against the materialism and the restrictive moral code of the bourgeoisie, and his need to redefine the role of art. As a result, French artists withdrew from the political and social scene and escaped into aesthetic isolation, into what Gautier defined 'Art for art's sake'. The bohémien embodies his protest against the monotony and vulgarity of bourgeois life, leading an unconventional existence, pursuing sensation and excess, and cultivating art and beauty.

#### The English Aesthetic Movement {ignore=true}

This doctrine was imported into England by James McNeill Whistler (1834-1903), an American painter who worked in England.
However, the roots of the English Aesthetic Movement can be traced back to the Romantic poet John Keats, as well as to Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Rossetti was a remarkable example of an artist dedicated wholly to his art. John Ruskin too, in his search for beauty in life and art, even while insisting upon moral values, paved the way for the works of Walter Pater (1839-94), who is regarded as the main theorist of the Aesthetic Movement in England.

#### The theorist of English Aestheticism {ignore=true}

Walter Pater's _Studies in the History of the Renaissance_ (1873) and his masterpiece _Marius the Epicurean_ (1885) were immediately successful, especially with the young, because of their subversive and potentially demoralising message. He rejected religious faith and said that art was the only means to halt the passage of time, the only certainty. He thought life should be lived in the spirit of art, namely as a work of art, filling each passing moment with intense experience, feeling all kinds of sensations. The task of the artist was to feel sensations, to be attentive to the attractive, the courteous and the cheerful. So the artist was seen as the transcriber 'not of the world, not of mere fact, but of his sense of it! The main implication of this new aesthetic position was that art had no reference to life, and therefore it had nothing to do with morality and did not need to be didactic.

#### Walter Pater's influence {ignore=true}

Pater's works had a deep influence on the poets and writers of the 1890s, especially Oscar Wilde, as well as the group of artists that met in the Rhymers' Club and contributed to _The Yellow Book_. This periodical, published from 1894 to 1897, reflected decadent' taste in its sensational subjects. The term decadent' generally implied a process of decline of recognised values. By the end of the century it was used as an aesthetic term across Europe.

#### The features of Aesthetic works {ignore=true}

A number of features can be distinguished in the works of Aesthetic artists:
* excessive attention to the self;
* hedonistic and sensuous attitude;
* perversity in subject matter;
* disenchantment with contemporary society;
* evocative use of language.

#### The European Decadent Movement {ignore=true}

Decadence must be seen as a European movement. In the late 1880s a group of French writers contributed to the journal _Le Décadent_; they were the Symbolists Rimbaud, Verlaine,Mallarmé, Laforgue, who were much influenced by Charles Baudelaire's _Les Fleurs du mal_ (1857). Joris-Karl Huysmans (1848-1907) wrote _A rebours_ (1884), a novel whose hero, Des Esseintes, tries to create an entirely artificial life in his search for unusual sensations. This character became the model for Wilde's dandy. The main representatives of Decadence in Italy were Gabriele D'Annunzio (1863-1938), with his novel _Il piacere_ (1889), and the poets Giovanni Pascoli (1855-1912) and Guido Gozzano (1883-1916). The poetry of Rainer Maria Rilke (1875-1926) was one of the most remarkable expressions of the Decadent sensibility in the German language.

## Victorian Drama
* ==p. 31==

Very little drama or not was produced in the Victorian period: the decline in the production of dramatic words is caused by:
1. predominance of the novel
2. the power acquired by the theatrical managers, who preferred to stage well known traditional plays, rather than try out new ones; many companies mainly performed Shakespeare, although with many of the text cut or even changed, in order to better suit the victorian tastes
3. many victorians did not appreciate drama as a form of art, since they still consider actor and actresses as people of little respectability and doubtful morality

There is one great innovation, related to the Victorian playhouse: the new theaters became smaller but more pretentious; they could be afforded only by the well off.

The typical features of the Victorian playhouse:
* semicircular
* lighted by gas light and later on by electricity, while the audience was left in darkness
* the stage was separated from the audience by a curtain, and this allowed the scenery to be changed

The new playhouses tended towards a more realistic staging, which made more use of actions and movement, and of setting. The keyword was to **reach the illusion of reality**.
The stage directions became longer and much more detailed.

On the one hand, through the use of this theatrical machinery, the staging was more spectacular but on the other hand there were also some negative consequences:
* this type of staging was more expensive: for the theatrical manager it became unprofitable to stage different plays during the same theatrical season
* the victorian age was a period of great performers, so actors and actresses demanded a higher salary for their job.

This finally leads to a lost of flexibility, who brought managers to stage traditions well know tragedies instead of new ones.

The **audience** at the time went to the theatre just to be amused, and not to meditate on problems.The type of theatre that the victorians demanded was farce spectacol and above all Melodrama.

This latter kind of theatre, **melodrama** was probably the most appreciated: they are highly schematic plays with stereotypical characters, absurd plots. The common features of all melodrama, is that good must triumph over evil. The victorian appreciated the morality on which melodrama was based, because the spectator could easily identify themself with the hero.
For certain aspects we can say that melodrama returned to the morality plays of the Middle Ages.

There is a more innovating and subversive type of theatre that was emerging at the time, of the form of **music hall**. They are a type of theatrical entertainment, characterized by a mixture of comedy and popular song. Music hall was considered a low form of theatre, also because it dealt with taboo subjects, such as sex. It dealt with these taboo subjects using the tecnique of the _double meaning_.
It was mainly appreciated by the working classes, and even though it was considered a low form of theatre, it was to be of great influence in the 20th century, both on early cinema, especially in the films of _Charlie Chaplin_, and on the work of Samuel Beckett.

After this period of stagnation, in which we have almost a gap in the production of new plays worth of note, with the last quarter of the 19th century, British Drama begins to show the first signs of revival. In fact the 1890s marked a reinessance in English dramatic art.

This period of renaissance in theatre wasn't limited to the British context. Drama was changing and improving all of the Europe, and we can now outline the influences coming from abroad, which had an impact on British drama.

### Chekhov

He was Russian. He replaced the lack of action with a constant inquiring into the psychology of his characters

### Strindberg
He is a Swedish playwright who mixed naturalism with psychology, providing a deeper insight into life, together with penetrating studies of women.

### Ibsen

He is from Norway. He modified the structure of the play by the _retrospective method_: disregarding the traditional method of construction based on 3 phases (_antecedent_, _climax_, _conclusion_), he skipped the antecedent and started just before the climax.
He used the stage as an instrument for social criticism and for attacks on bourgeois hypocrisy.
He confronted his audience with real life problems, without indulging in humour or any other form of relief
Features of Ibsen’s plays:
- introduction of problem drama
- realism in characters and language
- psychological exploration
- rejection of sentimentalism
- rejection of conventional moral ending
- defence of women’s independence
- focus on middle class people
- social commitment

His influence was particularly evidente on the works of **George Bernard Shaw**, who was one of the main British playwright of the period. It is almost ironical to note that Wilde and Shaw had two opposite careers:
- during his life time Oscar Wilde's commedies were highly appreciated; he satires the values of the Victorian upper classes, but he did so in a very subtle way, which did not offend the people he was satirising; it was more Wilde's life and his homosexuality that made people turn the vindictively against him
- Shaw was an highly respected people, he was the model of decency, but his plays were not appreciated at the time, because they criticize to harshly the society of the time. He saw the theatre as an instrument for social and political change.
On the contrary Wilde denied the moral significant of art.
