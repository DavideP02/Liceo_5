# The Victorian Age
==p. 405 - IV==

> It was the best of time, it was the worst of times. It was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity. It was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair
>
>— Charles Dickens, The Tale of Two Cities

It was an age of contradiction and opposites: age of progress, but also of problems in justice.

The Victorian Age usually is meant from 1837 - 1901, during the reign of Queen Victoria. Actually the Victorian Age started in 1832, with the _Great Reform Bill_, a law, which is usually taken as the watershed between the romantic age and the victorian age.
This Reform Bill shifted political power from the hands of the landowners to the hands of manufacturer. It implied cultural changes as well.

## Social area
The new ruling classes were as ruthless as those that had governed Britain during the first phase of industrial revolution, but they began to be gradually aware of the inhuman levels of exploitation of the workers: they were more careful on the workers:
* at a political level this awareness gave rise to a serious of reforms that in the end improved the conditions of life and work of the proletarians, avoiding at the same time that social revolution that, according to Marx’s analysis, should have taken place in Britain first;
* among the common affluent people this awareness took the form of humanitarianism, philanthropy and sentimentalism;
* the Victorian novelist, mostly belonging to the middle classes, shared the same values and models of life of their reading public, and approached with this attitude to the main problems of their times; they felt a sense of guilt, and they find a solution in philanthropy, and they acted according to philanthropy granted from a position of social and economic privilege; at the same time they thought that their only responsibility was to expose their problems
* there were some _good points_:
  1. more general **prosperity** that was spreading in Britain;
  2. medical, mechanical and scientific **progress**;
  3. improvement of **literacy**
  4. the reform of a **middle class parliament**, conceded to the working classes, created a widespread belief that social peace was possible and that progress was limitless
  * these good points account for the optimism which characterized the whole period, and for the self-confidence and self-complacency of the middle classes which were alse able to impose their values on the working class; the most important value was _respectability_
* the _negative points_ are:
  1. **poverty**
  2. **prostitution**
  3. **exploitation of labour**
  4. **cruelty to children**
  * these evils were removed from the conscience of people by being concealed under the veil of hypocrisy;
  * it was a characteristic tendency of the victorian society to deceive itself in relation to its responsibilities and faults; some political writers exposed this attitude, attacking the fundamental insensitivity of their times

---

The Victorian Age was a very complex age, marked by religious, social and political unrest and confusion.

The country underwent a gradual but continuous process of democratisation, and greater freedom was given to catholics

The class that benefited most from the changes of the time was the middle class, which was made up of manufactures, merchants and bankers.
This class increased in power, and took the control of the Government. This class was also favoured by progress in industrial and technological field.

This situation led to widespread optimism, due to colonial expansion, scientific and technical results, and improvement in transports.
Middle class people believe that _happines_ could be reached **through technical progress**.

The Victorians were proud of their **welfare**, of their good manners, of their middle class values, and tended to ignore the social problems that still afflicted most of the population.
The working class lived in misery and distress. The new hurbans conditions, and the growth of slums have created a lot of health problems.
Whole families were often crowded in a single room, where lack of hygiene, occasionally led to cholera.

The government create the **work houses**, in order to solve these problems.
They were institutions built by government and run by parishes, where families who couldn’t support themselves were confined. Here sexes were segregated and people were barely fed. People were always hungry and dirty and miserable.

The reason why the work houses were built was the poverty, whether it was the result of bad behaviour or bad luck, was virtually regarded as a crime, and it was penalised as such. This was the mentality for which workhouses were created.
Also debtors were held in work houses, or at least in jail.

Also education had his problems, because teachers were often incompetent, but they controlled the students through corporal punishment.

This particular situation which saw prosperity and progress on the one hand, and poverty, ugliness and injustice on the other, which opposed conformism to corruption, moralism and philanthropy to money and capitalistic greediness, and which separated private life from public behaviour, was called **Victorian Compromise**.

The situation nevertheless aroused the concern of many and many reformers and theorists, who, for social or humanitarian reasons, tried to improve living conditions of the poor, at all levels, including hospitals, schools and prisons.
It is thanks to their care and actions that parliament passed so many acts regulating work, sanitation, the condition of children, the exploitation of teenagers.

### Evangelicalism
A religious movement that acted in this period was **Evangelicalism**; it was inspired by the teachings of John Wesley, the founder of **Methodism**.
The evangelicals were deeply concerned with _human problems_ and _social reforms_. They contributed to the _abolition of slavery_ and the _First Reform Bill_.
They had a puritanical view of life, so they advocate
* the abolition of certain public entertainments,
* a strict observance of Sunday
* very strict code of behavior.

### Bentham’s Utilitarianism
==p. 12 - V==

According to Utilitarianism, an action is morally right if it has consequences that lead to happiness, and wrong if it brings about the reverse. Therefore all institutions should be tested in the light of reason and common sense to determine whether they are useful, measuring the extent to which they provide for the material happiness of the greatest number of people.
Utilitarianism suited the interests of the middle class and contributed to the Victorian conviction that any problem could be overcome through reason.

### Fabian Society
It was in this particular atmosphere that the **Fabian Society** was founded in 1884, by Sidney and Beatrice Webbs. It was inspired by Marxist doctrines, and it consists in **socialists** who advocated gradual reforms instead of drastic revolutionary measures.
Its name derived from _Quintus Fabius Maximus_, which was a general called “the delayer”, because in his campagne against Annibale avoided direct engagement.

### Respectability
Manners underwent a deep change in this period; under the influence of Queen Victoria herself the age became excessively **puritan**; sex became a taboo subject, and all the words with sexual connotation were replaced by synonyms.

The key word in this period was ==**respectability**==

#### Victorian Family
The conventional morality of the time found its best expression within the family, where the father was the _authority_ and the mother was to be _submissive_ and _fruitful_. In fact Victorian Families were usually very large, also because Queen Victoria herself had 9 children.

Middle class women were expected to be _frail_, _innocent_ and _pure_. They were confined within the family. They were devoted to _respectable jobs_ like teaching.

But restrictions involved men too; they were forbidden to gamble, swear and drink hard.

Clothes were very formal because appearance was very important.

#### The Victorian House
Victorian people were busy with making money and social climbing, so they had little time for art, and this indifference led to bad taste in buildings and furnishings.
These needed to be a status symbols, and so houses became pretentious, but _not beautiful_.  The interiors were overcrowded with _ornaments_, _decorations_ and _furniture_.

## Challenges from the scientific field
==p. 13 - V==

In his work _On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection_ Charle Darwin presented his theory of evolution and natural selection. He later developed it in his work _The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex_.
According to Darwin’s theory:
* all living creatures in existence have developed their forms through a slow process of change and adaptation in a struggle for survival;
* favorable physical conditions determine the survival of a species, unfavorable ones its extinction ;
* man evolved, like any other animal, from a less highly organized form, namely a monkey.

On the one hand, Darwin’s theory discarded the version of creation given by the Bible; on the other hand, it seemed to show that the universe was not static but perpetually developing, that the strongest survived and the weakest deserved to be defeated.

### The Oxford Movement
==p. 13 - V==

British Catholics replied to the challenges of science by returning to the ancient doctrines and rituals. The religious revival found its expression in the movement headed by the English cardinal John Henry Newman, which went under the name of “Oxford Movement” because it began at Oxford University.

## Queen Victoria
She belongs to the Hanoverians (George I, George II, William IV). She was the niece of William IV, and she took the throne when she was only **18 yo**, and she would reign for 64 years and she would became a symbol of the entire age.

## Reforms

When Victoria got to the throne she found a Country in difficult conditions, because there was discontent among the working classes, due to a period of _economical crisis_.
### Chartist Movement
A direct consequence of this economical crisis was the birth of the **Chartist Movement**: their name went from their proposal of a charter of reforms, made up of 6 points:
1. _universal suffrage_
2. _annual parliament_
3. _payment for parliament member_; so far the member of parliament were not paid, so only rich people could afford to stay there
4. the _right for a man without proprieties to be elected_
5. _secret ballot_
6. _equal electoral districts_; until that moment the electoral districts were of the same area and dimensions, without taking care of the density of population; in this way it was very easy for affluent people to control districts with a small number of people (called _rotten boroughs_)

This petition was not accepted in parliament, and so Chartist disappeared from policy in 1848, since they were considered politically immature, and their projects were doomed to failure, but with the passing of time all their reforms had been actuated, but for the _annual parliament_.

### Parties and politics

In 1825 the ==**Trade Unions**== [sindacati] were legalized, and they became stronger and stronger. In 1868 there was the first Trade Union Congress, and a status was given to the movement.

The long reign of queen Victoria saw a succession of great Prime Ministers, some belonging to the Tories (now conservatives), and some belonging to the Wigs (now liberals; in the modern parliament is the Labour to oppose to Conservative, born in 1906).
The two parties, that were ==**Tories and Wigs**==, had different opinions, but they agreed for a second and a third _Reform Bill_.
* The **Second Reform Bill** was passed in 1867, and it extended the right of vote to Town Labourers, while peasants and miners couldn’t vote.
* Only with the **Third Reform Bill**, in 1884, that the latter were given a right to vote. In this way the number of electors doubled, since suffrage had been extended to all male workers

It only refers, obviously, to men. _Women couldn’t vote_

Many representatives of the working class may now be elected, entering the _house of commons_.

In 1897 the **independent Labour party** was formed (born as a movement), and finally the working class may compete widely for politically power. They were transformed into a real party in 1900, and had a great political success in 1906.

### Economical reforms

An other social question was the ==price of **corn**==; it was kept artificially high by the government, through protective tariffs there were called the _Corn laws_, which restricted the importation of foreign corn.
An association was formed against the Corn laws, and it obtained the repeal [cancellazione] of these laws in 1846, with the support of a conservative Prime Minister, Peel.
The repeal caused much discontent in the _Conservative Party_, since it wanted to protect the interests of the _landed gentry_, by which it was largely supported.

The upper class and the industrial class both believed in a policy of ==**Free Trade**==, that is an uncontrolled flow of commercial transactions with foreign nations. It was a free exchange of good, without protective tariffs, and it brought great wealth to England.

### Other reforms

The Victorian Age was marked by a great number of social achievements and reforms;
* **The Factory Act**, which regulated and improved the conditions of workers in factory
* **Ten Hours’ Act**, which limited the working hours to ten a day, for both men and women.
* **The Mines Act**, which prohibited the working of women and children in mines
* **The Public Health Act**, which improved health condition
* **The Education Act**, which reorganized elementary education
* **Adoption of the English week**, by which Saturday Afternoon was devoted to pleasure and entertainment


## Foreign Policy

### Ireland
The population of Ireland consisted mainly of Catholics, and they were very poor and they became even poorer by recurrent famines; with only potato crops to feed on.
In the 1840’s there was a potato famine, and so potato crops failed several times; this caused mass starvation and emigration.
In order to stop a mass emigration and starvation, Charles Parnell, which was an irish leader, demanded Home Rule (an independent constitution), but these reforms were rejected twice by the conservatives, and Ireland obtained Home Rule only after WWI.

### British Colonial Empire
The Victorian Age was above all the period in which the great British Colonial Empire took its final form.

There was an enlargement of the indian territories, as a consequence of the indian mutiny [ammutinamento indiano] in 1857, and after this mutiny England acquired the control of India. In 1876, Queen Victoria became Empress of India, that was India, Bangladesh and Pakistan.

The English Empire had enormous proportions, involving Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, Ceylon, Singapore, Hong Kong, Gibraltar, Malta and Cyprus.

This period is characterized by two wars:
* from 1899 to 1902 England was at war against two south-african areas, called Orange and Transvaal; these two areas were interesting because there were diamonds and gold; these two regions were ruled by dutch colonists, called Boers; it gave England the supremacy over the two dutch reasons
* **The Crimean War**: it was the only international’s war during Victoria’s Reign; it was originated by a dispute between Turkey and Russia, over the boundaries of the Turkish empire.; England and France, declared war on Russia, together with Turkey, because they were afraid of the growing power of Russia in the balkans; the war broke out in 1854 and 1857; Russia was defeated, but the conflict exposed the disorganization of the English Army particularly in the field of sanitation; public opinion was horrified at the news to the terrible conditions in which sick and wounded soldiers were kept; a young lady of noble origins, **Florence Nightingale** went to Crimea organized hospitals, obtained nurses medicines and bandages from England, laid the foundations of Medical Services for soldiers; she inspired the creation of the Women’s Corps in the international _Red Cross_.

## Victorian Poetry
==p. 22 - V==

During Victoria’s Reign poetry became more concerned with social reality.
This led on the one hand to the creation of majestic poetry linked to the myth and the belief of the greatness of England; on the other hand to the creation of poetry more inclined towards anti-myth and disbelief which had to solve the ethical problems raised by science and progress

Now the poet was seen as a “prophet” and a “philosopher”. People expected that he could reconcile faith and progress, as well as sprinkle a little romance over the unromantic materialism of modern life.

The major poets of the age were **Alfred Tennyson** and **Robert Browning**.

Victorian Poetry started as a revival of Romanticism but soon mirrored the sense of uneasiness that characterized the Victorian Age.
The most important poets were **Alfred Tennyson** and **Robert Browning** and they felt a moral responsibility through their poems towards their public.
