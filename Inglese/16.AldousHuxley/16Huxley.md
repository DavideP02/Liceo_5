He was born in Surrey in 1894, into a family of noted biologits and natural scientists.
He was physically weak in his eyes, and when he was young he became nearly blind, and so he wasn't able to follow a scientific career, but he succeeded into graduing in english in Oxford, deciding to became a writer.

His most famous novel is *Brave New World* (1932). During his life he published novels, essays and poems.
This novel is a mixture of distopian, science fiction and philosopical essay.

In the late 40s he moved to California, when he developed an interest into misticism and para-psychology.

He finally died in 1963, the same day that the american president Kennedy was assasinated, and so his death passed almost unnoticed.
It is as a novelist that he is mostly remembered, with his most succesful novel is *Brave new world*. There is doubt whether we can consider him a novelist in the real sense of the term: critics agree that Huxley is not novelist in the common sense of the word, they prefer to consider him a novelist of ideas.

**Novels of ideas** are novel based on a certain idea, so they revolve around the develpment of a certain point of view. 

## *Brave new world*

In *Brave new world* he develop the idea of the danger of **scientific progress**: he wanted to denounce the danger of the scientific progress. It is a science fiction novel in which Huxley portray an alarming picture of a future society: he describes a futuristic society in which technological and scientific progress have taken control over individual life.

*Brave new world* is a quotation from Shakespeare's play *The Tempest*: these words are pronounced by Miranda, the Daughter of Prospero. Since she was a child she lived alone, exiled on an island with her father: the first time she was other people she exclame: "Oh brave new world, that has such people in it".
Shakespeare is the greates english writer, he is the symbol of art, so probably with this title Huxley wanted to remind the reader about the fact that art is denied in the futuristic society he describes.

In this society technology and scientific progress had reach their utmost, everything is well structured and well organized, but people have lost their most authentic qualities, and they acts like puppets. 

The story is set in the seventh century AF (After Ford, the inventor of the modern factory system and of its essential organizational principle: the assembly line; he is regarded as a sort of deity in this story). Society is well structured, and it is based on stability, which is achieved through a specific cast classification system. It is a hierarchical society. 
- At the top we find the **alphas** and **betas**, they are the intellectual and the administrators, they are the most intelligent and the most physically perfect men and women.
- Below there are the **gammas**.
- At the bottom there are **deltas** and **epsilons**: they represents the manual workers, almost slaves. They accomplish the humbless tasks, and this is their role

People are born artificially, through artificial process: babies are produced and drawn in bottles, and even before they came into existance, they are brainwashed to conform to the cast they are predetermed to. They must be happy with their cast, they must like it and accept it. From the very beginning, even before being actually born, they are manipulated so that they are happy with their predetermined role.

The second key concept is **happiness**: everyone must be happy. Happiness is achieved through the consumption of a drug called **soma**, it is a sort of allucinogenon, that produces feelings of wellbeing, happiness, sexual promiscuity. Sex is seen as a form of mindless entertainment.

Art, literature, phylosophy are prohibitted in this society, since it might ruin the conditioning of every person.

The protagonist is **Bernard Marx**, an alpha-plus speciment, but he is dissatisfied with this antiseptic world, so one day he decides to visit a reservation in New Mexico. A reservation is a place, that is kept as the world was before scientific progress. Here he meets a savage, called John, and he decides to take John with him in London (which is the setting in place).

In London **John** is firstly fascinated by the world, but then he realises that it is not an happy world, so he rebels against its lack of freedom, passion, individuality, privacy, conformity.
He decides to live in an abandoned light house, he stats to lead a sort of Robinson Crusoe like existence, but he soon turnes into a sort of attraction to turists, and so he finally commits suicide: he understands that there is no possibility of being happy. There is no way out from this world.

### Themes

**Fordism**: with this reference of a mass production system that in this case is not applied to cars but to human beings: Henry Ford is a deity, who splits time; he is regarded as the most important person in the world, for his invenction of assembly line. Fordism replaced religion.

**Progress**, and in particular the effects of the scientific progress on the individual; tipically progress is regarded as something positive, but in this case Huxley emphasises the negative consequences related to an extreme belief in scientific progress.

**Technology**: Huxley wants to highlight the dangers of our worship for technology to the decadence of art, literature, phylosophy; technology is became the main value of the society.

**Totalitarianism**: this is a society characterized by an all-powerful state. It's similar to *1984* by Orwell. Orwell focused on a form of political totalitarianism, whil Huxley was more concerned with a technological totalitarianism.

### Features

It is characterized by a mixture of different literary genres: fable, science fiction, philosophical essay.

Its language varies from the clinically scientific to the satirical. Huxley's narrator often introduces veiled criticism of the world he is describing through particular comments or choice of a phrase.
The language varies in this novel. 

An other feature is that we can consider it a **prophetic book**: it is prophetic both in the long and in the short term.
On a short perspective, *Brave New World* anticipated the nazi policy of producing an arian master race, devoid of inferior individual. This arian master race was devoid of inferior individual.
In a long term, this novel anticipated contemporary biological manipulation. It anticipated the possibility of human cloning.

It is both an **utopian** and a **dystopian** novel. This society is a perfect society, where everything is perfectly organized, based on happiness. This happiness is possibile as long as no one questions the pillars on which this society is built, and that's why it is actually dystopian.

**Mental conditioning** is not invented by Huxley, but he took inspiration from the studies of a behavioural psychologists, Ivan Pavlov, who carried out experiments mainly on dogs; he wanted to condition the behaviour of dogs, through a system of punishment and rewards; he demonstrated how it is possible to condition someone's behaviour through this system.
Huxley showed how such research might be applied for dobious ends.

### T: *An unforgettable lesson*

> The nurses stiffened to attention as the D.H.C. came in.
> "Set out the books," he said curtly.
> In silence the nurses obeyed his command. Between the rose bowls the books were duly set outâ€“a row of nursery quartos opened invitingly each at some gaily coloured image of beast or fish or bird.
> "Now bring in the children."
> They hurried out of the room and returned in a minute or two, each pushing a kind of tall dumb-waiter laden, on all its four wire-netted shelves, with eight-month-old babies, all exactly alike (a Bokanovsky Group, it was evident) and all (since their caste was Delta) dressed in khaki.
> "Put them down on the floor."
The infants were unloaded.
> "Now turn them so that they can see the flowers and books."
> Turned, the babies at once fell silent, then began to crawl towards those clusters of sleek colours, those shapes so gay and brilliant on the white pages. As they approached, the sun came out of a momentary eclipse behind a cloud. The roses flamed up as though with a sudden passion from within; a new and profound significance seemed to suffuse the shining pages of the books. From the ranks of the crawling babies came little squeals of excitement, gurgles and twitterings of pleasure.
> The Director rubbed his hands. "Excellent!" he said. "It might almost have been done on purpose."
> The swiftest crawlers were already at their goal. Small hands reached out uncertainly, touched, grasped, unpetaling the transfigured roses, crumpling the illuminated pages of the books. The Director waited until all were happily busy. Then, "Watch carefully," he said. And, lifting his hand, he gave the signal.
> The Head Nurse, who was standing by a switchboard at the other end of the room, pressed down a little lever.
> There was a violent explosion. Shriller and ever shriller, a siren shrieked. Alarm bells maddeningly sounded.
The children started, screamed; their faces were distorted with terror.
> "And now," the Director shouted (for the noise was deafening), "now we proceed to rub in the lesson with a mild electric shock."
> He waved his hand again, and the Head Nurse pressed a second lever. The screaming of the babies suddenly changed its tone. There was something desperate, almost insane, about the sharp spasmodic yelps to which they now gave utterance. Their little bodies twitched and stiffened; their limbs moved jerkily as if to the tug of unseen wires.
> "We can electrify that whole strip of floor," bawled the Director in explanation. "But that's enough," he signalled to the nurse.
> The explosions ceased, the bells stopped ringing, the shriek of the siren died down from tone to tone into silence. The stiffly twitching bodies relaxed, and what had become the sob and yelp of infant maniacs broadened out once more into a normal howl of ordinary terror.
> "Offer them the flowers and the books again."
> The nurses obeyed; but at the approach of the roses, at the mere sight of those gaily-coloured images of pussy and cock-a-doodle-doo and baa-baa black sheep, the infants shrank away in horror, the volume of their howling suddenly increased.
> "Observe," said the Director triumphantly, "observe."
> Books and loud noises, flowers and electric shocksâ€“already in the infant mind these couples were compromisingly linked; and after two hundred repetitions of the same or a similar lesson would be wedded indissolubly. What man has joined, nature is powerless to put asunder.
> "They'll grow up with what the psychologists used to call an 'instinctive' hatred of books and flowers. Reflexes unalterably conditioned. They'll be safe from books and botany all their lives." The Director turned to his nurses. "Take them away again."
> Still yelling, the khaki babies were loaded on to their dumb-waiters and wheeled out, leaving behind them the smell of sour milk and a most welcome silence.
> One of the students held up his hand; and though he could see quite well why you couldn't have lower-cast people wasting the Community's time over books, and that there was always the risk of their reading something which might undesirably decondition one of their reflexes, yet â€¦ well, he couldn't understand about the flowers. Why go to the trouble of making it psychologically impossible for Deltas to like flowers?
> Patiently the D.H.C. explained. If the children were made to scream at the sight of a rose, that was on grounds of high economic policy. Not so very long ago (a century or thereabouts), Gammas, Deltas, even Epsilons, had been conditioned to like flowersâ€“flowers in particular and wild nature in general. The idea was to make them want to be going out into the country at every available opportunity, and so compel them to consume transport.
> "And didn't they consume transport?" asked the student.
> "Quite a lot," the D.H.C. replied. "But nothing else."
> Primroses and landscapes, he pointed out, have one grave defect: they are gratuitous. A love of nature keeps no factories busy. It was decided to abolish the love of nature, at any rate among the lower classes; to abolish the love of nature, but not the tendency to consume transport. For of course it was essential that they should keep on going to the country, even though they hated it. The problem was to find an economically sounder reason for consuming transport than a mere affection for primroses and landscapes. It was duly found.
> "We condition the masses to hate the country," concluded the Director. "But simultaneously we condition them to love all country sports. At the same time, we see to it that all country sports shall entail the use of elaborate apparatus. So that they consume manufactured articles as well as transport. Hence those electric shocks."
> "I see," said the student, and was silent, lost in admiration.


The exstract is taken from the second chapter, and the setting is a scientific lab; there is the director of the center, and he is with some students, because he wants to show them the process of mental conditioning used with babies belonging to the lower casts.

The director tells the nurs to put the babies on the floor, where there are roses and books with bright images, that were meant to attract the babies. At the beginning they are free to crawl. 
At a certain point the director gives a signal, the nurse presses a lever, and then the room is filled with the sound of an explosion. The children receive mild elettic shocks. 
After this the children start screaming and crying, their bodies moves spasmodically.

They want these babies to develop a feeling of hatery towards nature and books-
If they loved nature, they probably want to be happy and spending their day in nature, but since they are supposed to work they have to hate nature.
If people read, they might develop dangerous thoughts that might decondition their reflexes.

Students are lost in admiration. No one questions the logic behind this experiment, because everyone is brainwashed from their birth
